Fiend
These denizens of dark and ancient woods are some of the most dangerous monsters known to man. Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads.
Like their smaller cousins, chorts, they live in thick forests, swamps and bogs. When possible they avoid humans, but when confronted, they kill them, and without much difficulty.
#bs;Mistaken Folktale. Legends often mistake fiends for sylvans ascribing to them the ability to speak, stand on two legs, gobble up cabbage, play pranks and work mischief around the household. The arrival of a true fiend in a region soon puts an end to such tales. The creatures do not speak, at best communicating with each other through grunts, snorts and moans. They get about on four legs and as for their "mischief"... they destroy farmsteads, devouring anything that can be devoured, including cabbage, if such is available, but also extending to poultry, pork, the family dog and then the family itself.
#bs;Hulking Menace.Their size alone makes fiends and chorts extremely dangerous — one blow from their powerful paws can kill a knight along with its fully-armored mount. Their enormous heft also makes them almost invulnerable to mundane weapons, the only sure way to put them down is magic and enchanted weapons. Furthermore, any wounds they receive heal at lightning speed. When a fiend is gravely wounded it will fight with increased aggressiveness, caring little for his own security while it deals tremendous damage to what stands in its path. Fiends are cunning fighter, if they are gravely wounded they will retreat, counting on their regenerative ability, and charge back into the fight, completely healed.
#bs;Third Eye. If that weren’t trouble enough, fiends need not rely on their strength and Stamina alone when fighting. Inexperienced hunters assume that the only danger coming from fiends is physical, they will die in the seconds that follow. Fiends can call on a more refined weapon: the third eye located in the center of their forehead. They can use it to impede their prey with a various array of powers. During these times their victim does not see anything beyond this single burning eye — the last thing they see before their death. The fiend’s third eye defines this monster as a force with which to be reckoned.
#bs;Controversial Origin. Many theories abound on the origins of fiends. The most popular ones give them a demonic ancestry, but truthfully none has ever be seen collaborating with demons or devils. Others believe them to be originated from the Feywild, basing this assumption on the somewhat similar powers they share with fomorians. It's true that these twisted giants have been known to take "pets", but imagining that the ferocious fiends could have ever been one of them is a conclusion that few are willing to make.
#h;Third Eye of a Fiend
The third eyes of fiends and chorts are powerful magically charged organs. This disturbing appendice doesn't die with the fiend. It's still alert even after the creature's death. If harvested from the corpse of the creature it can be used as an alternative spell component. The third eye can be consumed to substitute any magical component of up to 5,000 gold pieces value, the eye is destroyed in the process. For this reason many wizard will pay a good price for it and some particularly brave and skilled hunters have made a lucrative carrier out of hunting the monster.

#h;Chort
Chorts are the somewhat smaller kin of fiends. Yet any adventurer who thinks their diminutive stature means they present no danger commits a grave error — the kind that can end his career permanently. Chorts fight with little finesse, running straight towards their opponent and trying to know him to the ground with the force of their charge. After downing their foe they bite, kick and strike with their claw tipped paws.
#h;Restless Eye
Wondrous item, rare, cursed (requieres attunement) This fleshy, evil looking eye is the Third Eye of a fallen fiend or chort. The eye merge with your forehead, blinking and staring independently from your eyes. The eye has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the eyebite spell at DC 15 from it. Additionally you gain proficiency with the Wisdom (Perception) skill or gain advantage on this roll if you are already proficient.
#bs;Curse. The eye is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the eye or you attune to it. Attuning to the eye curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; extracting the eye, a dangerous operation, fails to end the curse. While cursed, if you have a neutral or good alignment, each long rest you must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, suffering from a Short Term madness (p.259 of the Dungeon Master Manual) on a failed save. If the save fails by 5 or more, you also suffers from a Long-Term Madness. The short-term and long-term madness can be ended with the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
#h;Optional: Curse of the Restless Eye.
When a fiend dies, the nearest intelligent creature of its body must make a DC 18 (DC 15 for a chort) Wisdom saving throw. In case of failure the creature gains a form of indefinite madness "I must keep the eye at all cost, it's now my most treasured possession".

#h;Leshen
Humans have long been fascinated by the wildwood-living in its vicinity was the source of tales about creatures ferocious and benign, friendly and hostile. As they started to settle deeper and deeper into the forests, respect for the unknown diminished. Lumber was gathered, stone abodes were built. As the pestilence that was humanity grew bigger, so did the forest’s and its inhabitants’ wrath.
#bs;Wrath of nature. At the heart of the forest lies a secret. In a place born of darkness and primeval nature, resides a mighty and terrifying guardian. Immune to human steel, it is believed the leshen is nature’s way of protecting the forest and the animals that live within it from the threat humans started to pose upon their ravaging expansion deeper into the lands. Sometimes called leshii or leszi, leshens are ancient and powerful forest spirits. Possessing a deer skull as a head and tree-like limbs, the sight of a leshen is a terrifying one. Villagers sighting one passing between trees will usually be clever enough to leave the woods at peace, even if it means for the village to starve, a preferable fate than to risk the ire of the creature.
#bs;All seeing Watcher. A leshen will turn nature itself against those that trespass on his lands. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within their territory — and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Animals, even timid and harmless ones, will be taken by a frenzy that will only stop with the death of the intruders, attacking on sight anyone they cross path with. Roots will sprout from the ground, trying to grapple, crush and strangle the unwary, burying them into deep earthy tombs, never to be seen again.
Thankfully, it's difficult to unknowingly stumble into the territory of a leshen. The borders of its charge are warded with totems made of roots, stones, plants and animal bones, hanging from trees or stacked on mounds. One may also have to destroy a leshen's warding totems to rid a forest of its presence. The totems are the eyes and ears of the leshen throughout the forest and crossing or destroying one is a sure way to declare war on the creature. leshens are also known to be able to appear and disappear unexpectedly near their totems.
#bs;Primeval Keeper. Leshens are the herald of nature in many ways, sometimes worshipped, this creature can heal other woodland animals and fey, and are known to care for the ones left at their totems, even domestic pets. With time and efforts, a druids can work in collaboration with them if a leshen comes to recognize the druid as part of his forest. Some call them the Old Gods, and believe they were here before the divinities even existed. In some small and rural communities, especially the ones far from major trade routes and industrious cities, the leshen is the only god recognized by the villagers and the glade under his protection is considered sacred ground. Leshens found in this setting tend to be more lenient toward lost souls wandering into their land, giving them warning sign and trying to drive them off their territory instead of killing them outright.
#h;A Leshen's Lair
A leshen lives in deep forest, usually near a grove or a clearing with a large concentration of totems made of natural materials and animal bones.
#bs;Lair. Actions of the Lair
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the leshen takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:
#ls;
#li;Roots and plants burst out of the ground, grappling and lashing at creatures. The area within 60 feet around the leshen becomes difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round. Huge or larger creatures are not affected.
#li;The leshen and allied creatures within 60 feet of the it are healed of 18 (4d8) hit points.
#li;A green mist fill the lair. All creatures within 60 feet of the leshen must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#le;
#h;Regional Effects
The region containing a leshen's lair is empowered by the creature's presence, creating the following magical effects:
#ls;
#li;sBeast creatures are empowered by the leshen's presence. Giant and Dire version of beasts creatures are more common here than anywhere else. Additionally Beast creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the leshen and are agressive toward intruders in the area.
#li;sThe leshen can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the control weather spell.
#li;The totems of a leshen allow him to watch over his territory within 6 miles of its lair. The effect is similar to the arcane eye spell, but the eye cannot move away from the totem.
#le;
When the leshen dies, all of these regional effects fade over 1d10 days.
#h;Black Root
Leshens called "black root" are unnatural, twisted creatures that were corrupted or created by vile magic. All leshens are caring for their land and protecting it jealously, but the black root is actually straying away from his territory, actively leading travelers and commoners astray to slaughter them inside its land and abduct their children. A black root was created by a night hag or a crone. By kidnapping a child from a village, trapping him into a tree trunk inside the leshen's lair and letting him starve to death there, a crone can corrupt a leshen with her magic. The tree will soon grow out of proportion, turning into a twisted blighted thing, sprouting gigantic black roots where blights plants (p.31 MM) start to grow and infest the region
#h;Black Root Regional Effects
Use these regional effects for a Black Roots Leshen instead:
#ls;
#li;Blights creature (p.31 MM) appear near the blighted tree in the lair of the leshen and start to spread their poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, any land or forest near the region will turn into a place of corruption.
#li;The leshen can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the control weather spell.
#li;Beasts creatures inside the region look sickish and unhealthy, carrying diseases. Eating game from this region expose a creature to the effects of the contagion spell, at DC 13.

Immune to human steel, it is believed the leshen is nature’s way of protecting the forest and the animals that live within it from the threat humans started to pose upon their ravaging expansion deeper into the lands. Sometimes called leshii or leszi, leshens are ancient and powerful forest spirits. Possessing a deer skull as a head and tree-like limbs, the sight of a leshen is a terrifying one. Villagers sighting one passing between trees will usually be clever enough to leave the woods at peace, even if it means for the village to starve, a preferable fate than to risk the ire of the creature.
#bs;All seeing Watcher. A leshen will turn nature itself against those that trespass on his lands. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within their territory — and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Animals, even timid and harmless ones, will be taken by a frenzy that will only stop with the death of the intruders, attacking on sight anyone they cross path with. Roots will sprout from the ground, trying to grapple, crush and strangle the unwary, burying them into deep earthy tombs, never to be seen again.
Thankfully, it's difficult to unknowingly stumble into the territory of a leshen. The borders of its charge are warded with totems made of roots, stones, plants and animal bones, hanging from trees or stacked on mounds. One may also have to destroy a leshen's warding totems to rid a forest of its presence. The totems are the eyes and ears of the leshen throughout the forest and crossing or destroying one is a sure way to declare war on the creature. leshens are also known to be able to appear and disappear unexpectedly near their totems.
#bs;Primeval Keeper. Leshens are the herald of nature in many ways, sometimes worshipped, this creature can heal other woodland animals and fey, and are known to care for the ones left at their totems, even domestic pets. With time and efforts, a druids can work in collaboration with them if a leshen comes to recognize the druid as part of his forest. Some call them the Old Gods, and believe they were here before the divinities even existed. In some small and rural communities, especially the ones far from major trade routes and industrious cities, the leshen is the only god recognized by the villagers and the glade under his protection is considered sacred ground. Leshens found in this setting tend to be more lenient toward lost souls wandering into their land, giving them warning sign and trying to drive them off their territory instead of killing them outright.
#h;A Leshen's Lair
A leshen lives in deep forest, usually near a grove or a clearing with a large concentration of totems made of natural materials and animal bones.
#bs;Lair. Actions of the Lair
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the leshen takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:
#ls;
#li;Roots and plants burst out of the ground, grappling and lashing at creatures. The area within 60 feet around the leshen becomes difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round. Huge or larger creatures are not affected.
#li;The leshen and allied creatures within 60 feet of the it are healed of 18 (4d8) hit points.
#li;A green mist fill the lair. All creatures within 60 feet of the leshen must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#le;
#h;Regional Effects
The region containing a leshen's lair is empowered by the creature's presence, creating the following magical effects:
#ls;
#li;sBeast creatures are empowered by the leshen's presence. Giant and Dire version of beasts creatures are more common here than anywhere else. Additionally Beast creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the leshen and are agressive toward intruders in the area.
#li;sThe leshen can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the control weather spell.
#li;The totems of a leshen allow him to watch over his territory within 6 miles of its lair. The effect is similar to the arcane eye spell, but the eye cannot move away from the totem.
#le;
When the leshen dies, all of these regional effects fade over 1d10 days.
#h;Black Root
Leshens called "black root" are unnatural, twisted creatures that were corrupted or created by vile magic. All leshens are caring for their land and protecting it jealously, but the black root is actually straying away from his territory, actively leading travelers and commoners astray to slaughter them inside its land and abduct their children. A black root was created by a night hag or a crone. By kidnapping a child from a village, trapping him into a tree trunk inside the leshen's lair and letting him starve to death there, a crone can corrupt a leshen with her magic. The tree will soon grow out of proportion, turning into a twisted blighted thing, sprouting gigantic black roots where blights plants (p.31 MM) start to grow and infest the region
#h;Black Root Regional Effects
Use these regional effects for a Black Roots Leshen instead:
#ls;
#li;Blights creature (p.31 MM) appear near the blighted tree in the lair of the leshen and start to spread their poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, any land or forest near the region will turn into a place of corruption.
#li;The leshen can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the control weather spell.
#li;Beasts creatures inside the region look sickish and unhealthy, carrying diseases. Eating game from this region expose a creature to the effects of the contagion spell, at DC 13.

#zl;image;Fleder.jpg;Fleder
#bp;Fleder
Common people believe that fleders are dead heathens who turned into vampires and rose from their graves. Being vampires, they attack sleeping people and drink their blood. According to peasants, a man bitten by a fleder becomes a fleder himself. This is nonsense, obviously, for towns would be completely infested by them after only a few weeks due to the creature's ravenous appetites.
#bs;Savage Killer. The fleder is a lesser vampire. Its appetite for blood is the only thing it shares with the noble princes of the night. A creature with animal instincts, deprived of any humanity, it can mutilate its victims terribly. Its head — triangular, with a flat face and horn-like protrusions with certain bat-like features, including the creature's face and ears — renders it similar to other animalistic vampires, such as Garkain or Ekimmara. With its glowing red eyes the fleder also resembles a demon and inspires terror in the heart of peasants and city folks alike.
#bs;Death from Above.The fleder is not a good flier, the membranes under its arms allowing only short jumps and attacks from above. Though not particularly smart, it knows that it gains an advantage and increases its chance of victory by suddenly attacking unsuspecting victims. The long, prehensile toes on the beast's feet allow it to hang head down from the ceiling, one of its favorite method to ambush a prey. One common mistake made by inexperienced adventurers when fighting a fleder is to assume that they are weaker during the day. To the difference of many of the other subspecies of vampires, fleders seem to be the ones the least affected by sunlight.
#bs;Terror of the Squalor. Fleder usually hunt in rundown city districts, especially where buildings are high and cramped, allowing the creature to use its agility to escape after a bloody meal. They are clever enough to recognize an inebriated prey, hunting near taverns to feed on unwary town drunks. Fleder are usually lone, nocturnal hunters, but in large cities, where they can cover a huge hunting ground, it can happen that a brood of this creatures band together. They then pick a common nest to rest during the day, often an abandoned church towers or an old windmill. They are also found in the wilderness, usually near cliffs and rugged, hilly lands where they can easily hide.
#bs;Fleder. When a giant bat feeds of the blood of the dead on desecrated ground, or directly from the veins of a higher vampire it can turn into a fleder. It is believed that the transformation can be adverted by nailing the bat to a wooden surface and stuffing it with garlic cloves. Some masters of the dark art, necromancy, can also raise fleder from corpses directly.

Foul Presence. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the garkain must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, unless the garkain is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is failed by 5 or more, it's also frightened until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the garkain's Foul Presence for the next 1 hour.
Spider Climb. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Stain. A creature wounded by the garkain's claws or bite takes an extra 10 (3d6) poison damage. If the target is a living humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a supernatural disease. The diseased target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies. The disease lasts until removed by a lesser restoration spell or other magic.
Actions
Multiattack. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

#zl;image;Garkain.jpg;Garkain
#h;Optional: Garkain's Stain
Garkain's saliva and blood carries all sorts of terrible diseases, able to kill a robust man in a few days. The undead body of the garkain is like a walking incubator, brewing terrible afflictions, empowered by the entropic nature of the monster.
#bs;Contagion: A creature affected by the garkain's stain quickly start to develop open wounds that never stop bleeding and festering boils. Any humanoid creature that spend more than 1 minute within 10 feet of an infected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the garkain's stain of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.
#bs;Serum: If no magical healing is available and no quarantine is set in place the garkain's stain can quickly spread and decimate an entire town. To prevent this a character that has proficiency with Alchemist's Tools or Herbalism Kit, and access to the proper equipment, can prepare a serum from the fangs on the initial garkain. The serum has a value of 40gp when its comes to crafting (see crafting rules p.172 of the Player's Handbook). One batch of serum is enough to cure 10 patients.
#bp;Garkain
Garkains, the filthiest of vampires, are uglier even than fleders. Since fleders are widely despised for their looks, it is easy to imagine how abominable garkains must be. As vampires, the creatures drink blood but they are also drawn to fresh meat, or even corpses. Garkains are more dangerous than fleders but are also far less common.
#bs;Face of Evil. No one in their right mind would qualify any of the bestial lesser vampires as beautiful, or pleasant to look at.
They all are mockery of an overgrown bat, twisted monsters that defy the laws of nature. Still, none other reaches the grotesque ugliness of the garkain. Similarly to fleder and ekimmara the garkain looks like a giant, somewhat humanoid-looking bat. Different subspecies of garkains can be found throughout the world, some have bloated, protruding faces, others have their brain burgeoning at the back of their head. No matter what, their face is always a nightmare to look at, the simple vision of a garkain inspires dread. Regardless of their powers, it is the nasty feeding habits of a garkain that makes them truly loathsome adversary. The bite and claws of a garkain can transmit deadly diseases, poisoning the blood at alarming speed after a single scratch.
#bs;Corpse-Eater. Garkain infestations are often mistaken for a ghoul problem. The two creatures do share a similar taste for the rotten flesh of corpses and favor cemeteries and catacombs for their hunting ground. Garkains do not seem to mind sharing their territory with other undeads, especially ghouls, wraiths and other garkains. The nature of this phenomena is unknown but some comparisons have been made with the ability of higher vampires to call other undead to serve them. It's rare, but not unheard of, to find garkains outside of cities. In most stories they were found in battlefields, feeding on the wounded and devouring the fallen.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or lose 7 (2d6) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to internal injuries. Each time the ekimmara hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 7 (2d6). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 16).
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated or restrained. Hit: 12 (1d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
Invisibility. The ekimmara magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the ekimmara wears or carries is invisible with it.

#zl;image;Ekimmara.jpg;Ekimmara
#h;Ekimmara
“Bah, ain’t nothing to fear. Ekimmaras, why, they ain’t nothing
more than overgrown bats.”—Anonymous city guardsman’s
last words
#bs;Chiropteran Marauder. Like other lesser vampires, ekimmaras are not, despite what village gossips might say, undead humanoids. Unlike their portrayals in ballads and legends, they look nothing like handsome, pale aristocrats with charming eastern accents, though, like katakans or nekurats, their stronger and clever cousins, they do bear a strong resemblance to overgrown bats. They also do not suck blood from the necks of virgins with a delicate, kiss-like bite — they tear them to shreds using long, sharp claws and then slurp the splattered blood off the ground.
#bs;Embodiment of Fear. Ekimmara are unusually cruel and exceptionally swift. They are able to quickly land blow after blow capable of smashing even the best dwarven-made armor into tiny shards. They are invulnerable to conventional steel and, therefore should be fought with a magical weapon. One should never attempt to tire them out or, gods forbid, wait for them to bleed to death. Remembering that they can regenerate back health quickly is a crucial point when it comes to slay them. Unfortunately, the legends are wrong and the sun’s rays do not turn these vampires to ash. They are vulnerable to sunlight, however, and when the sun stands at its zenith their regeneration is considerably slowed.
#bs;Invisible Scourge. Ekimmara are patient hunters, they hide in the shadows and demonstrate exceptionally acute hearing and can turn invisible, waiting unseen while dread of their unpreventable attack overwhelms their victim. Ekimmara show a true sense of cruelty, for they like to display their kill in public, leaving them in visible places for the mutilated corpse to be found.
#bs;Slumbering Fiend. Like most lesser vampires, ekimmaras usually hunt in urban areas at night, choosing a secluded place to hide during daylight hours. If its blood source becomes scarce and no other hunting ground is available, or the ekimmara becomes trapped somewhere, the monster can become dormant. Ekimmara can slumber for an extended period of time, potentially centuries. Adventurers entering a ruin with a past of unexplained bloody killings should make sure they come prepared. Vampire kills never miraculously stop and they might well be the next meal of a very hungry ekimmara.

Innate Spellcasting. The alp's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\rAt will: gaseous form (self only), hypnotic pattern\r2/day each: greater invisibility (self only), telekinesis
Shapechanger. If the vampire isn't in sunlight, it can use its action to polymorph in to a Medium female humanoid or back into its true form. While in humanoid form, its statistics, are the same. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
Vampire Weaknesses. The vampire has the following flaws:
Blood Addiction. In order to control itself near a source of blood, the vampire must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, on a failed save it looses control and enters Blood Frenzy. If the temptation is strong (an open wound, the smell of blood), the vampire has disadvantage on the saving throw. In the presence of the blood of a virgin the vampire fails automatically. Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Actions
Multiattack. The vampire makes two melee attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
Claws (Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 14).
Bite (Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated or restrained. Hit 7 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

#zl;image;Alp.jpg;Alp
#h;Optional: Alptraum
A living humanoid bitten by an alp vampire while asleep is under the effect of the alptraum, the alp's curse. While under the curse the creature will receive vivid erotic dreams about a beautiful elven woman during its rest, lusting over her even while awake. A creature under the effect of the curse has small, red marks on its scalp, called tarnkappe. The curse is lifted if the alp dies or a remove curse spell is casted on the creature.
Each time the creature takes a long rest it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, with disadvantage if the alp bit it that night, or gain a level of exhaustion and gain no benefits from its long rest.
While the creature is under the effect of the curse, the alp that bit it gains a supernatural sense, allowing it to knows the distance to and direction of the creature, unless the two of them are on different planes of existence. If the creature dies, the alp knows.
#h;Alp
Few other monster inspires so many myths and fallacies as the alp. Folk tales describe their charm and their beautiful, seductive voices, as well as their loathing of virgins. What is true beyond any doubt is that they move noiselessly and attack by surprise, rarely giving their victims as much as a chance to scream in terror.
#bs;Blood Addict. As higher vampires, alps, or alpor as they are also called, don't need blood to survive but are extremely addicted to it. Of all the higher vampires, alp are the weakest when it comes to controlling their darkest urges. They lack the restrain and manipulative skills of the bruxa or the cunning edge of the katakan, making it very difficult for them to hide in the midst of civilisation. To indulge in their addiction alps rely mostly on the poor judgement or social isolation of their prey, hunting lonely men, drunkards or notorious perverts.
#bs;he-Devil. Alps, just like bruxae, are womanoid, exclusively appearing as female creatures. They have the power to change into a beautiful female humanoid, often an elf, and for this reason they are commonly mistaken for succubi, people believing them to be lecherous and inclined to seduce handsome young men. Some even pretend they are able to turn into a black dog or a venomous toad, but this is pure nonsense.
#bs;Home Invader. If cornered, alps are more than capable fighters, their natural magical abilities allow them to daze and feed on their prey easily and their hands end in dangerous claws. Truthfully though, alps prefer to attack unconscious victims. They will sneak into bedrooms at night, draining the blood of the sleeper and leave before dawn. The alp will then return the following nights to feed again on the same victim, until it's caught or the victim dies. For some unknown reason, alps seem to develop a mystical connection with their sleeping victims, having a hard time to let them go.
This weakness can be used against the alp, for it makes its behavior somewhat predictable.
#bs;Between Beasts and Men. Alps are ambiguous vampires, they cannot stand to be too far from humanity, as they need to satisfy their blood addiction, nor can they hide directly among men, due to their lack of control. Therefor an alp is reduced to share the same refuges and lairs than lesser vampires, lurking between the world of men and beasts. To the contrary of lesser vampires, alps do care for confort and will build their lair accordingly, garnishing it with furniture and accommodations, even art sometime.

Vampire Weaknesses. The vampire has the following flaws:

Sunlight Hypersensitivity. While in sunlight, the vampire has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Actions
Multiattack. The vampire uses its Otherworldly Gaze and makes two melee attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
Claws (Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 15).
Bite (Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated or restrained.

#zl;image;Bruxa.jpg;Bruxa
#h;Optional: Kiss of Darkness
Some of the most talented bruxae learn the ability to enthrall a person with a kiss, much in the same way other vampires use their gaze to do so. A bruxa with the kiss of darkness option has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP). When a humanoid or an undead kisses a bruxa, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the vampire until the vampire dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the vampire's control and can't take reactions, and the vampire and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the vampire.
#h;Bruxa
It is said that at night bruxae haunt attractive young men and drink their blood. This silent and seductively beautiful creature closely resembles a fey. In fact, she is a vampire, and one of the deadliest kind. They approaches gracefully and are easy to overlook as a threat. These vampires move quietly in the dark to suddenly emerge near their victims. An eerie cry echoing through corridors indicates an approaching bruxa – at once both beauty and the beast.
#bs;Wanton Villain. Bruxae are womanoids and take the form of beautiful women, leading some to mistake them for nymphs, but their long fangs and thirst for blood always betray them.
The bruxa is built on contradictions. She appears as a beautiful woman, but when she is hungry or attacking, she is terrifying. Her black pupils and blank face contrast sharply with her pale feminine silhouette. The bruxa is a higher vampire and therefor drinks blood but do not depend on it to survive. She often finds a victim to become her lover and a constant supply of sustenance at the same time.
#bs;Fair and Deadly. The bruxa finds the smell of garlic to be socially inconvenient at most, and she considers holy symbols to be interesting examples of handicraft. She endures the light of the sun well, but she prefers the darkness of the night.
If threatened, they attack with their talons and rip the victim apart, pausing only to savor the blood of their dying foe. The greatest threat comes from the bruxa's voice. The creature can scream with the might of a banshee, wrecking the mind of the sternest man, making him easy prey for the vampiress.
Blindness is as great a threat as this ghastly scream. The pitch-black gaze of bruxae can deprive their enemies of sight, or even paralyse, in order for the fiend to play cat and mouse with its prey.
#bs;Queen of the Night. This alluring yet frightful fiend is the most manipulative of vampires, to the exception maybe of the elusive nosferat. Bruxae are experts at hiding in plain sight, blending in perfectly among mortals and throwing off their trail easily vampire hunters. Few can tell what they really are when they are not on the hunt. They can charm equally undead and mortals, surrounding themselves with servants, bodyguards and lovers, with a preference for lower vampires and alps. The most powerful of them can enslave a creature through their bite, binding mystically their victim to their will.
They are obediently served by an entire court of suitors and sycophants, tending to their every twisted needs.
#bs;Wolves among Sheep. Bruxae are as far as you can possibly be from the classical myth of the vampire inhabiting dark crypts and ancient ruins. If they do so, its by personal taste or because things turned sour and they are now in hiding.
Instead they favor places with a lot of trafic and where mortals let their guard down, like brothels, merchant outposts, inns or theaters. Some bruxae even make a business out of their needs, trading favors against blood. Still, bruxae are aware that people will not take kindly to their feeding and they always prepare multiple escape plans.

#zl;image;NightMother.jpg;Night Mother, Bruxae
#h;Night Mother
After surviving centuries of undeath, outwitting dozens of rivals and gaining great occult powers a bruxa can pretend to the title of night mother. These bruxae have mastered the art of intrigue and manipulate the mortal world through their numerous undead minions and mortal agents. They conspire to expand their influence through elaborated plots and place spies in every institution of a city, ruling from the shadows.
#h;A Night Mother's Lair
A night mother establishes its lair in the most luxurious place its influence can allow. They often choose a vibrant place of entertainment, like a coliseum, an arena or a large theater, where hundreds of people come and go at all time. Others live in large estates at the edge of town where they host decadent balls that mortals would kill to be invited to. They weave webs of illusions and build secret passages to move unseen through their lair, hiding their treasures in secret vaults guarded by vampires and traps.
#bs;Lair Traits A night mother's lair might have any or all of the following effects in place:
Darkness creeps avidly over the light inside the lair. The radius of all light source inside the lair is reduced by half, regardless of their origin, natural or magical. The capacity of living creatures to see through darkness, like darkvision, is also reduced by half. Creatures able to see through magical darkness are unaffected.
Undead creatures inside the lair have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.
Animals are terrified by the lair and refuse to step inside. If a beast creature starts its turn inside the lair it must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, in case of failure its frightened for 1 minute.
If the night mother is destroyed, these effects fade over instantly.
#bs;Bewitching Wine Wondrous item, rare, cursed
This wine, distilled from the blood of a night mother vampire, is usually kept in a superbly adorned decanter. If drank by a living creature, the creature instantly falls unconscious for 8 hours and age by 1d4 years. During its sleep the creature has the most vivid erotic dreams, more realistic than life and fulfilling all its darkest fantasies. When it wakes up, the creature remembers the dreams perfectly and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, gaining a level of exhaustion on failure.
#is;Curse. The dreams induced by the wine are so intense that reality pales to compare, letting the cursed creature eternally unsatisfied. Until the curse is removed the creature gains a form of indefinite madness "I'll do everything I can to relive these dreams again"

#zl;image;Mula.jpg;Mula
#h;Mula
When a mother wants to frighten her children into good behavior, they often make allusion to the mythical mula "If you misbehave, the mula will come to get you". Grown men only speak of the mula in hushed voice, warding themselves against evil the second after. Mulae, or moola as sometimes called, are nicknamed "the scourge of mankind" for a good reason. Once they are on the hunt their are unstoppable killing machine.
bs;Embodiment of Terror. Mulae are humanoid vampires that can somewhat pass for humans if watched from a distance. From close vicinity though, nobody would mistake them for anything else than a terrifying creature of the night. Their are completely hairless, with hellish facial features: a mouth filled with nightmarish fangs and bloodshot frenzied eyes.
Despite their feral appearance, mulae are highly intelligent vampires, capable of elaborate planning and preparation but their ravening appetite will force them into isolation. Mulae are usually seen as a masculine entity but can be of any gender or simply androgynous. As higher vampires mulae do not need blood to survive but are extremely addicted to it.
#bs;Scourge of Mankind. All vampires have the reputation to feed on humanity, hunting in the dark corners of civilisation. Mulae though, play a particularly important role in vampire folklore. Mulae are known to prey on the wicked, going to great length to bring their ravenous judgment on killers, criminals and the morally corrupted.
They are famous for making their presence known in the most brutal ways, leaving a chance for honest folks to abandon the miscreants before the mula's hunger consumes the entire town. As a prideful monster, the mula has full confidence in its abilities and will answer a direct challenge.
#bs;Irreverent Manslayer. Mulae vampires have a profond fear of everything that is holy. They will avoid sacred ground if they can and will never enter willingly a place of worship if they can avoid it. Most people believe that mulae are invincible, abandoning their home to find shelter in temples when one is spotted. They are not that far from the truth.
Mulae are invulnerable to common steel and can regenerate most wounds quickly, or almost instantly if they can feed. Putting them down requires radiant attacks or literally cutting them down to piece. Even such measures might not suffice, for they can rejuvenate if not destroyed properly.
#bs;Reoccurring Cleansing. Like the nosferat or ekimmara the mulae can enter a state of dormancy, waiting for better times to come. Some, usually once they were destroyed, will rejuvenate in the cold respite of a grave. Depending how badly their body was destroyed, it can take up to a decade for the creature to reappear. Unusually thick fog over a graveyard is often the sign that a mula is resting there. Other mulae simply enter torpor once they bloody work is accomplished, waiting for their formidable sense of smelling to pick up the scent of wicked blood once more.

#zl;image;Nightwraith.jpg;Nightwraith
#h;Optional: Wraith Rejuvenation
Often, simply destroying the physical form of a wraith isn't enough to get rid of it permanently. Most wraith haunt a specific location and sending them to their final death will require some extra work. If destroyed, a wraith will regain all its hit points in 24 hours, unless prevented to in the following ways:
#bs;Nightwraith. Reforms at the place of its haunting unless a dispel evil and good or greater restauration spell is used on its remains and its bones are splashed with holy water and then burned.

#bs;Hym. Reforms unless the hym's initial victim is freed from the indefinite madness of the wraith.
#h;Wraith
A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. 
The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.
#bs;A wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
#h;Nightwraith
When the sun sets, the fields become the domain of midnight demons who draw their power from moonlight. Dark as the night itself and filled with grief, they roam the fields lit by silver light. Woe to those who are spotted by a nightwraith.
#bs;Born of Grief. Some say you should fear a nightwraith as much as you should pity it. Nightwraiths exude an immense sadness, coupled with an helpless wrath. One can feel instantly the profond distress coming from the wraith, pouring out of it like a well of endless despair. The story of a nightwraith is always a tragic one, they were killed by loved ones, betrayed by a close friend or the victim of an hideous plot. Some legends say you can put a nightwraith to rest by avenging it, bringing its tormentor to justice or making their killer weep for them sincerely on their grave. The truth is, nothing is ever so easy.
#bs;Terror of the Night. Like noonwraiths, nightwraiths are mostly found in rural areas and only a handful of cases involving a nightwraith have been reported in cities. Travelers fall victim to them most often, but if legends are to be believed they also sneak into huts at times and murder peasants in their sleep. Do not believe the old wife tales and think yourself completely safe from nightwraiths during the day. They appear under the light of the sun as well, but are much weaker then than after dusk. Nightwraiths are, like most wraith, drown to the site of many deaths and their presence increase near battlefields or mass graves.

#bs;Noonwraith. Reforms at the place of its haunting unless a remove curse spell is used on the anchor bounding it to this world. The anchor could be a wedding ring, a bride's veil, wedding vows or even, in some cases, a person or its remains.
#bs;Plague Maiden. Reforms somewhere in the region unless it was destroyed in the area of effect of a hallow spell specifically casted for this purpose.
#bs;Hym. Reforms unless the hym's initial victim is freed from the indefinite madness of the wraith.
#h;Wraith
A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. 
The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.
#bs;A wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
#h;Noonwraith
Noonwraiths are born at high noon out of heat, sadness and the sweat of ploughmen. In the hot air above the fields, they gather to dance madly, creating air vortexes, but the specters dislike being watched. Those who peep are forced to dance with them.
#bs;Innocence Lost. Crops swaying in the fields on a windless day indicate that a noonwraith is nearby. These monsters kill humans who venture into the fields at noontime, thus, farmers return home or seek shelter in the shade at this time of the day. The noonwraith is a sun-burned old woman.
Clothed in a linen, she hovers just above the ground, her hair white from constant exposure to the sun. Streaks of light drift about her, and when necessary she uses these to blind her opponents. The noonwraith's frock and shoes suggest she once was a young girl, who venturing into the fields, joined in a spectral dance and thus entered the spirit world as a wraith.
#bs;Wronged Brides. The noonwraiths are the spirits of young women and girls who died violent deaths right before their weddings. Driven mad with pain or anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible. Contrary to popular belief, noonwraiths can also be encountered at night, but are much weaker then than during the day.

#zl;image;PlagueMaiden.jpg;Plague Maiden
#h;Plague Maiden Regional Effects
The region containing a plague maiden suffers of the creature's insidious presence, creating the following magical effects:
Using natural and magical healing is a difficult thing in the region. All Wisdom (Medicine) checks are made with disadvantage and casters that want to use healing magic must first make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failure the spell has no effect and the spell slot used is wasted.
Epidemics start to spread quickly in the region. Saving throws made against diseases in the region have disadvantage and incubation time is reduced by half.
Vermins, especially rats and flies, start to converge toward the region and show signs of unusual swarm behavior and increased aggressiveness. These swarms are always carrying diseases.
When the plague maiden is destroyed, all of these regional effects fade over 10 days.
#h;Plague Maiden
When plague ravages a region, a spirit will sometimes walk its lands, a ghost resembling an ill woman whose flesh rots off her bones and in whose wake crawls a cavalcade of rats and vermines. No one knows whether this spirit brings the pox with her or is merely drawn to it like a moth to a light. Yet it is certain that she delights in dealing pain and suffering, in hearing the howling and moaning of men.
#bs;Subtle Influence. Many have called into question the very existence of plague maidens, or pestae, as they are sometimes called. Only two confirmed sightings of such a creature have ever been recorded, both during times of raging epidemic. The truth is that the work of a pestae can most of the time be attributed to natural causes. It's very difficult to assert with certainty the presence of the creature and only the most knowledgeable of scholars, wraith-hunters and apothecaries can detect its work.
#bs;Deceitful Spirit. Some suggest that plagues maiden can pass for other type of ghost or wraith, hiding their presence and true identity on purpose. As the name “plague maiden” suggests, these wraiths take the appearance of females, though exactly why that is remains a mystery. Most scholar speculate they, like other such wraiths, arise from the powerful emotional charge associated with certain circumstances of death, such as death preceded by a long and particularly painful illness. To the difference of many other wraith the plague maiden are not bound to a location and can travel great distances, they go were epidemics spread or move to new regions to start them, which of the two is uncertain.
#bs;Feverish Worship. Those afflicted by the supernatural disease of a pestae will sometime experience fever induced visions, showing them a feminine figure floating over them.
In some regions raging with epidemics, plague cults have spread, actively exposing members to the disease to receive the "blessing" of the lady. In some rare cases some of these individuals are living in an inexplicable state of harmony with a devouring cancer, wrapping their body with scabs and boils but somehow keeping them alive, sometime long after their life expectancy.

#h;Arch-Wraith's Lair
An arch-wraith stands at the center of its Domain of Dread.
The fortress of the wraith can take many shapes, depending on who it was in life. A crumbling keep in a forest of tombstones, a flesh cathedral surrounded by hundred of worshiping souls, a bone-made spire topping a jagged cliff, all are possible lairs.
#h;LAIR ACTIONS
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the arch-wraith takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:
The arch-wraith wraps itself into a shroud of magical darkness, until initiative count 20 on the next round. While under the shroud the arch-wraith is immune to spells of 6th level or lower unless it wishes to be affected. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects and has resistance to radiant damage.
The arch-wraith summons a swarm of mad wraith and specters, howling unbearable sounds of madness and despair as they pass through the battlefield. Each non-undead creature that can hear must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
The arch-wraith calls forth the enslaved souls at its command. Specters and wraiths materialize and attack one creature that the arch-wraith can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The specters and wraith then retreat.
#h;Regional Effects
A region haunted by an arch-wraith suffers from its nefarious energy, creating the following magical effects:
- Mystical mist spread over the region. The mist is a shadow crossing leading to the arch-wraith's Domain of Dread in the Shadowfell (see p. 51 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
- The arch-wraith can expand or shrink the size of its Domain of Dread at will. It can modify as well the geographical features, creating chasm filled with bones, hill of corpses, river of blood or any kind of terrain it wishes. The change takes 1 minute to occur.
- Throughout the land, apparitions manifest and reenact scenes of the tragic events that took place. Some of these apparitions happen at random, while other reenact at precise times of the day or the year. A character witnessing one of these apparitions must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed, assuming the personality of one of the apparition and playing its part in the drama until it unfolds.
- When the arch-wraith is destroyed, all of these regional effects fade over 1d10 days.
#h;Beyond the Mist
The land under an arch-wraith's influence contains a
supernatural mist, hanging between the world men see and the one they cannot. By stepping into the mist, a shadow crossing really, one can break through the veil between worlds and enter the arch-wraith's Domain of Dread in the Shadowfell. The domain is entirely under the arch-wraith control, making it a god-like entity in its kingdom, a god trapped in its own tragic story. As for the rest of the Shadowfell, the domain is a twisted and warped-distorted reflections of the region haunted by the wraith. The domain is an infinite expanse, expanding far beyond the geographical limits of its Material Plane equivalent.
- Undead creatures can cross in and out the mist at will, but when doing so they are not driven by reason and logic, but by a thoughtless, irrational need, carrying the will of the arch-wraith.
- A living creature entering the mist must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, incapable of leaving the domain of dread by simply walking out of the mist. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mist's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.
Creatures trapped in the mist don't age. A creature trapped within the domain can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the domain until freed.
- The gloomy atmosphere and almost tangible despair that seeps through the domain affects all living creatures stepping through it. Creature must resist the Shadowfell Despair (see p. 51 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) after only an hour passed in the domain of dread.
- The soul of a creature dying in the domain of dread becomes trapped here, joining the ranks of the enslaved wraith and specters serving the arch-wraith.
Until the arch-wraith is destroyed permanently the creature cannot be resurrected or brought back to life by any mean, unless the arch-wraith is willing to bargain for it (see the Bargain).
#h;The Bargain
Tails of heroes braving countless dangers to rescue their true love from the clutch of an arch-wraith abode for a reason. The only known way to free the souls captured by the monster is to slay it, an impossible task for most mortals, or to bargain with it. These tails always end up tragically, the hero striking an impossible deal with the creature in hope to save their beloved. In theory though, it is possible, after overcoming many challenges, to bargain for a specific soul with the arch-wraith. The wraith will always put nearly impossible conditions to fulfill if it agrees (see Terms of the Bargain for examples). Once the bargain is made, the arch-wraith can use its magic to cast a true resurrection spell. If the bargain's terms are broken the resurrected creatures crumbles to dust and the arch-wraith is free to raise the soul into one of its most powerful servant, a remnant.
#bs;Terms of the Bargain. d100
01- 20
The creature must leave the Domain without sleeping or sustaining itself. If it sleeps, eats or drinks it will suffer from amnesia, forgetting his entire past with the person it came to save. The domain of dread will expand almost indefinitely, tempting it along the way as the climate and the journey become increasingly harsher.
21- 40
The creature must take a cursed artefact, connected to the arch-wraith story, outside the domain. Doing so allows the wraith to expand its influence over a new region.
41- 60
The creature must leave the domain of dread in a limited time, with only just enough time to do so if it hurries. Dangerous obstacles will appear along the way, with a safer but longer alternative offered to avoid them.
61- 80
Every morning the creature will die, while its loved one is resurrected. Every evening the loved one will die, as the creature is resurrected. The two will only cross path briefly for a minute while they trade places in life or death.
81- 00
The character can never name or look at the dead person, otherwise she will disappear as dust taken by a supernatural wind.
#h;Remnant
A remnant is a powerful undead reanimated by an arch wraith with the power of a broken bargain. Sometimes called draugir, remnants are usually death knights, revenants, wights or even, in rare cases, mummies. Remnants are keeping their personality and memories but are twisted by the arch-wraith's power, always turning evil. These creatures live to torment the ones that made a bargain to free their soul from the clutch of an arch-wraith but failed ultimately, breaking the terms. The remnant is identical to its usual type of undead and gains the following features:
- The remnant has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws against the creature that made the bargain to save it. The creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls and saving throws made against the remnant.
- The remnant knows the distance to and direction of any creature that made the bargain to save it, even if the creature and the remnant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the remnant dies, the remnant knows.
- A remnant can arise anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when its soul has been freed from the arch-wraith can it be truly destroyed.

#h;Hym
#zl;image;Hym.jpg.Hym
Some men have got good reason to fear their own shadows. A tyrant slowly looses grip over his kingdom, shutting out all his advisers, accusing his most loyal knights of plotting against him. The father that drown his children during the last famine screams at them in the street, asking for forgiveness one second and cursing them the other. These are all signs of Hym's haunting. These wraith torment the guilty, the wicked and the mad, driving them always further down the path of insanity.
#bs;Attracted by Wickedness. Monsters most commonly claim innocents as their victims: tardy merchants, reckless children and travelers who wander into dark woodlands out of misplaced curiosity. None of the above need fear hyms, however. These wraiths only latch onto particularly despicable or guilty individuals who have committed some unspeakable crime. To all others, they remain completely invisible, hiding in the Border Ethereal. When they do show themselves to the one they torment, they appear as a tall, shadow-clad, humanoid silhouette with long, sharp claws.
#bs;Tormentors. Yet hyms do not sink these claws into their victims. Instead, they sap their strength indirectly, through inflicting suffering. Speaking in a voice only the victim hears, they drive him to commit acts of violence, aggression and self-harm. A hym will seize on a guilty person’s worst fears and weave out of them hideous visions, slowing driving the poor soul into madness. Evil creatures are certainly the ones that should fear the hym most, but those that committed acts of wickedness in the name of a greater cause should equally fear for their soul.
#bs;Descent into Madness. Those tormented by a hym are incapable of restful sleep, for they are tormented by evermore-frequent, incredibly-realistic nightmares. At times the victim will become extremely on edge, yelling pleas or threats at invisible phantoms or confessing his guilt out loud in the hope this will end her torment. This act does not, however, bring any relief, for the hym will not leave until it has addled its victim’s wits completely or driven him to suicide.
#h;Optional: Tricking a Hym
In theory, a hym can be tricked to leave its victim. Hyms attack those who have guilty conscience and can be tempted to take a new, fresher host. Tricking the creature is a daunting task though. The trickster can't know its a trick, he needs to truly believe he committed a fool deed. If the new host doesn't feel true sorrow the hym will sense it and won't take the bait. When the hym realizes it has been tricked, it will be forced to leave, giving its sanity back to its victim and abandoning its lair.
#h;A Hym's Lair
A hym's lair completely depends on the nature of the person its currently haunting. The lair will usually have a significance for the victim, probably where she committed her fool deed.
#bp;Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hym takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:
#ls;
#li;Signs of haunting are manifested, blood poor over the walls, black gooey ectoplasme boils on the ground or dreadful screams echo in the lair. All non-undead creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn.
#li;Unholly energy suffuse through the lair, all undead creatures in the lair have advantage on all saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
#li;The temperature drops significantly inside the lair, slippery ice forms on surfaces, making a 20 foot radius difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto it for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

#zl;image;Vargheist.png;Vargheist
#h;Vargheist
"The Vargheist had attacked us in the night, striking simultaneously and silently from opposite sides of the campfire. Alexander had been off to one side, relieving himself, and was able to shout an alarm. Fortunately for us they flew off with their prize rather than press the attack, or I fear we might all have lost our lives before we beat them off." — Kastar Handlin, travelling merchant 
#bs;Winged Legend. Vargheists are the darkness within a vampire's soul made manifest. Spoken in dark legends as towering winged humanoid monstrosities, these horrific creatures are said to be once powerful vampires that have succumbed themselves unwillingly to the darker and more bestial side of their nature due to an overexposure to dark magic and madness. Though the Vargheists once walked and talked as noble lords, these curse-born Vampires have devolved into ravening predators desperate for the taste of blood. They prowl in packs, ready to pounce upon the least sign of weakness, tearing down their prey with crimson claw and bloody fang. 
Dark Metamorphosis.The creation of a Vargheist is a strange metamorphosis that takes place far from the eyes of mortal. Those who come off worse in the endless power struggles of the vampires often find themselves prematurely buried, locked away in chain-bound coffins and sculpted sarcophagi, nestle upside-down like cocoons. They are left at the mercy of their own relentless thirsts, for there can be no greater suffering for a vampire than to not die for aeons from the great thirst that wracks their body and destroy their former personality. 
Whilst the transformation from humanoid into monster takes hold, the muscular Vargheist will crack open its stone prison with a great effort. Casting aside its chains, the creature unfolds its leathery wings and rears up into the darkness, letting loose a terrible scream of rage and betrayal. 
#bs;Vicious Hunter. The vargheist first instinct is to hunt, after so many years deprived of blood it is desperate to rejuvenate and drink fresh blood. What was once a proud lord of the dead is forever cursed to an existence as a ravening beast. 
Vargheist are far from stupid, they are vicious hunters, picking weak and isolated prey, waiting for a member to stray away from the group to surprise him and take him into the night. More importantly, vargheist are pack hunters, working together to lure a quarry into a trap, maneuvering him toward its packmates, waiting in ambush. 
#bs;Cursed Eternity. Though each Vargheist emerges from its prison far stronger in body, it is invariably weaker in mind. 
After centuries of thirsty confineme nt, all they really want to do is feed. They dwell in ghastly domains, within the deepest, darkest forest or on the walls of extensive castles. These creatures are easily bound to a higher vampire's will as a result, and are sent to hunt down their ennemies, terrorise the local population or simply as dreadful watch dogs.

Frightful Presence. Each creature of the vampire's choice that is within 120 feet of the vargheist and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ancient vargheist's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

#zl;image;Vargheist.png;Vargheist
#h;Ancient Vargheist
Over the centuries particularly old vargheist regain a measure of their abilities. These creatures often become pack leaders or instead turn into lonely hunter, their greed and thurst for blood driving them away from the pack.
#h;Vargheist
"The Vargheist had attacked us in the night, striking simultaneously and silently from opposite sides of the campfire. Alexander had been off to one side, relieving himself, and was able to shout an alarm. Fortunately for us they flew off with their prize rather than press the attack, or I fear we might all have lost our lives before we beat them off." — Kastar Handlin, travelling merchant 
#bs;Winged Legend. Vargheists are the darkness within a vampire's soul made manifest. Spoken in dark legends as towering winged humanoid monstrosities, these horrific creatures are said to be once powerful vampires that have succumbed themselves unwillingly to the darker and more bestial side of their nature due to an overexposure to dark magic and madness. Though the Vargheists once walked and talked as noble lords, these curse-born Vampires have devolved into ravening predators desperate for the taste of blood. They prowl in packs, ready to pounce upon the least sign of weakness, tearing down their prey with crimson claw and bloody fang. 
Dark Metamorphosis.The creation of a Vargheist is a strange metamorphosis that takes place far from the eyes of mortal. Those who come off worse in the endless power struggles of the vampires often find themselves prematurely buried, locked away in chain-bound coffins and sculpted sarcophagi, nestle upside-down like cocoons. They are left at the mercy of their own relentless thirsts, for there can be no greater suffering for a vampire than to not die for aeons from the great thirst that wracks their body and destroy their former personality. 
Whilst the transformation from humanoid into monster takes hold, the muscular Vargheist will crack open its stone prison with a great effort. Casting aside its chains, the creature unfolds its leathery wings and rears up into the darkness, letting loose a terrible scream of rage and betrayal. 
#bs;Vicious Hunter. The vargheist first instinct is to hunt, after so many years deprived of blood it is desperate to rejuvenate and drink fresh blood. What was once a proud lord of the dead is forever cursed to an existence as a ravening beast. 
Vargheist are far from stupid, they are vicious hunters, picking weak and isolated prey, waiting for a member to stray away from the group to surprise him and take him into the night. More importantly, vargheist are pack hunters, working together to lure a quarry into a trap, maneuvering him toward its packmates, waiting in ambush. 
#bs;Cursed Eternity. Though each Vargheist emerges from its prison far stronger in body, it is invariably weaker in mind. 
After centuries of thirsty confineme nt, all they really want to do is feed. They dwell in ghastly domains, within the deepest, darkest forest or on the walls of extensive castles. These creatures are easily bound to a higher vampire's will as a result, and are sent to hunt down their ennemies, terrorise the local population or simply as dreadful watch dogs.

#zl;image;Katakan.jpg;Katakan
"Great Mother, protect us from evil, from unclean devils and foul demons, and most of all from the clutches of katakans and nekurats...” — Fragment of a prayer 
#bs;Higher Hybrid. If ekimmara embrace the feral side of vampires and bruxae their manipulative minds, katakans and their more dangerous kin, nekurats, are the frightening combination of both. Katakans are higher vampires, the most dangerous kind. They ally the strength and ferocity of their lesser kind and the intellect of their higher kin. Katakans are shapechangers as well, capable to pass for perfectly humans if they desire so, or to change into a monstrous hybrid of an enormous bat with long fangs and even longer talons. #bs;Sofisticated Taste. Katakans on the hunt hide in the shadows, using their power of invisibility until they are ready to strike. Of all the vampire breeds katakans are the most selective when it comes to their prey. Katakans almost exclusively feed on one specific type of victim, depending on the vampire's own taste. Young and fair noblewomen, drunkards loaded on vodka, leprose's blood, all are very plausible delicacies for the vampire. A katakan will go to great lengths to fulfill its addiction, infiltrating mortal society and assuming a common identity or securing a haven close to its blood source. 
#bs;Empowered by Darkness. Katakans are notably smarter and more powerful than ekimmaras. Their power only increases at night, and so an adventurer should take additional precautions if they hunt one at those late hours. 
Alternatively, the hunter should wait for daylight, so the katakan’s natural regeneration is impaired. When hunting a katakan it is imperative to remember one simple fact: you will not get the drop on him and it is very likely that you are already being stalked. Katakans are invulnerable to steel, regenerate quickly, and demonstrate acute hearing. They also demonstrate an exceptionnal sense of smelling, for they are able of identifying the blood of their favorite prey over great distances, much like sharks. 
#bs;Unique Habits. To paint an average picture of a katakan's lair is a futile task, for there is as many types of lairs as there is of katakans. Few monsters show such a sense of individuality. 
They are loners by essence and will very seldomly associate with other vampires, unless they can be bribed with a constant blood source, or feel threaten by a foe they cannot overcome. Most katakans will not even entertain the idea, and such unlikely alliances are always short-lived.

#zl;image;Katakan.jpg;Nekurat
#h;Nekurat
Empowered by their proximity to the Shadowfell, these katakans wield terryfying magic over the dead and entropic energies, twisting and corrupting the land by their mere presence. Many rule small isolated hamlets and forgotten rural area, terrorising the local population to satisfy their bloodthurst. Much like the bruxae, the nekurat is a lord of the night, surrounding itself with a host of shadows and shadow demons. They are obscessed with their studies over the occult powers of necromancy. To satisfy their thurst for knowledge they will often maintain correspondence with creatures such as liches or other masters of the dark art. 
#h;A Nekurat's Lair
In the darkest corners of the earth, in crypts, catacombs and derelic castles ever-filled with darkness live the nekurats and their immortal host. 
#h;Regional Effect
The region containing a nekurat is tainted by the creature's presence, creating the following magical effects: 
- The sun never fully shines in the land. Even during the day the sky is dimmed by fog or storm clouds, or the light is strangely muted. The light is still bright but isn't considered sunlight for the purpose of effects and vulnerabilities, such a vampire's, tied to sunlight. 
- Crops, harvests and meat coming from this region aren't nutritious enough to feed properly a person, no matter how much is ingested. A character spending a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1) in the region automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. The hunger won't kill him, but will certainly leave him in a state of constant exhaustion. 
- Natives from the region are born with difformities, wrapped and twisted by the entropic energies that suffuse the land. We suggest using the mongrelfolk profile if you own the supplement Curse of Strahd. 
- The land is plagued by the undead. All matters of ghouls, shadows, skeletons and zombies will randomly raise from cemeteries, mass graves and other place with a strong connection to death. 
When the nekurat is destroyed, all of these regional effects fade over 10 days.

Their sturdy construction and unwavering will made it easy for them to wade into waves of mortal opponents, slaying multiple creatures with every cleaving strike.
#bs;Timeless Obedience. Even though their archmage master has long since passed, the Raiment army continues to wage their endless war on all that cross their path. Without the need to sleep, eat, or breathe, the only thing that ends a Raiment's ageless crusade is the destruction of its body by blade or magic.
#bs;Arcane Legion. As Raiments raid the countryside, they pass the knowledge of settlements and trade routes from one another in an unknown fashion. It has been observed that Raiments alerted to the presence of adversaries will alert other Raiments out to a distance of 500 ft. Only to have the newly alerted Raiments alert additional forces a further 500 ft. more. An area can quickly become overrun as more and more Raiments abandon their wandering to seek out battle with the newly discovered foes.

Honored Dead. Unlike other undead spirits, a Shade has voluntarily returned from the afterlife and, as such, can never truly be destroyed. lf it is reduced to o hit points while not possessing a body, it is shunted to the Ethereal Plane where it will remain for 10 minutes. During this time, the Shade's Etherealness ability can not be used to move it back into the Material Plane. If it is attacked by a weapon or effect that affects Ethereal creatures. it must make a Death Saving Throw. On a success. the Shade cakes no damage, though it remains Ethereal. On a failure, the Shade is returned to the afterlife until the Necromancer uses the summoning ritual detailed below.

It otherwise uses the corpse's statistics, but doesn't gain access rn the target's knowledge. class features, spellcasting abilities, or proficiencies though if the target was capable of speech, the Shade can communicate in any language the Shade knows.\rThe corpse appears as it did a moment before it died with any wounds being closed or healed over and it stops decaying. This effectively extends the time limit on raising the corpse so long as the ongmal death is also within the time limit.\rThe possessed corpse requires air, food, drink. or sleep if it normally required these while living. If the target is raised or resurrected by any means the Shade is forced from the body and may not possess it again.\rThe possession lasts until the possessed corpse drops too hit points, the Shade ends it as an action, or the Shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell.

#zl;image;Crone.png;Crone
#h;Crones
#bs;Ancient Monstrosity. The isolated corners of our world harbor creatures older than humans, older than academies and mages, older even than elves and dwarves. The Crones are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and, since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made daughters out of dirt and water.
#bs;Life-saving Parricide. A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of land. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals, and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land - men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, the land was drowning in blood.
The daughters saw their home nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her into a bog. Her blood watered a mystical oak, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land, and so the daughters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the earth, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.
#bs;Earthly Goddesses. Common folk refer to the crones "The Ladies of the Wood", “Norns”, or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of their land, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. In foul times, when plague or famine steals the harvest, when the gods have abandoned them, when the mighty do not care for their fate, the folks turn to the Ladies for help.
#bp;A Gift from the Ladies
If one listens to tells and stories, you will learn how to plea for help from a crone, such help always comes at a price though, but the ladies have the reputation to always keep their word. This is how one begs help from the Ladies:
Find a child, young and innocent, and search out the Ladies' shrine - that is where the Trail of Treats begins. Set the child off on the trail and it shall follow its sweet track and find the Good Ladies. The child will never want for anything ever again, for the Ladies are kind and generous. Standing before their shrine, pronounce your request and the Good Ladies will hear, for they see and hear all that takes place in their demesne. If you made the offering as it must be done, your supplication will be heard.
Such boons may include but are not limited to: ability score improvements, new feats, or epic boons found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 232). The gift lasts until the crone chooses to dismiss it or the crone dies. A wish spell can also end the pact.
A creature that makes a pact with a crone gains a mystical brand somewhere on its body, the brand is unique to each crone. The crone can communicate through the person over any distance, even from another plane of existence, speaking through its mouth. Once per month, the crone may charm the creature as if using the geas spell. The creature automatically fails the saving throw to resist the spell, and it can’t be ended by any normal magic except for a wish spell, which also ends the pact.
#bs;Fiendish Appetite. In the more ghastly legends, crones are said to know over a dozen recipes for human soup. During their sabbath crowns truly feed on human flesh, cooking men and children in infernal pots spiced with root from the cursed trees growing in their lair. In whispered tales, for if they spoke too loudly the crones would hear it, villagers speak of the tribute demanded in the form of human ears. The ears hung from trees, allowing the crones, through the use of primeval magic, to heard all that happened in their land.
#h;Elder Curse
Simple curses are easily dealt with by clerics, druids and wizards, becoming nothing more than a temporary annoyance for the wielders of the faith and arcane. However, in ancient times, magic was expressing itself differently, demanding sacrifices to be tamed, powering itself on blood, life essence and grievous trials. Elder curses tap into these ancient powers, a form of magic that is primal and raw, brutal and cruel. Such curses are not so easily dispelled and will resist most form of magic. Nothing short of a wish spell can remove an elder curse but each elder curse also must have a single means of removing the curse with some deed that the DM designates:
The elder curse must be casted by the crone as a ritual, taking an hour to perform. The effects can target one creature, without limit of distance or planar location, as long as the crone add a part of the target (strand of hair, nail clipping, blood, etc.) as a spell component, consumed during casting.
The elder curse can duplicate the effects of a bestow curse, contagion, symbol, true polymorph, or even, if several crones partake in the ritual, a wish spell (Spell DC 18, +2 per crone performing the ritual after the first). Every crone involved in the ritual cannot use their innate spellcasting ability until they completed a short rest.
The deed to lift the curse must be something that the target can accomplish within one year, assuming the task is undertaken immediately (burning all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, climbing the tallest mountain of the world, slaughter an entire bloodline...). Killing the crone doesn't end the curse.
The target of the elder curse can have help accomplishing the deed. In fact, someone else can accomplish the deed as long as removing the curse is the expressed purpose of the deed.
If someone who doesn’t know about the curse accomplish the deed, the curse remains.
#bs;Elder Magic. Crones wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from the elements and destiny and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses. The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the land in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.
#bs;Many Sisters. Although theoretically born from the same mother, crones do not necessarily like or even work with each other. Truly enough, some form covens, gather for great sabbath and maintain correspondence with distant sisters, but it is equally true that some hate each other viscerally and wage war against their brethren over feuds so ancient that none but them can remember why. The simple truth is that crones are very unique individuals, and that no simple rule can define their complex relationships.
#h;A Crone's Lair
A crone's lair isn't usually where she lives, but a mystical center of energy, usually tied to the death of its mother. It holds great significance and importance in the performing of her magic. Sabbaths, seasonal rites and other ceremonial sacrifices are held at the lair or in close vicinity.
#bp;Lair Traits
A crone's lair has all of the following effects in place:
A crone can only cast an elder curse or control a creature that made a pact with her from within her lair. Creatures other than the crone can’t teleport into the lair or use portals and planar travel to enter the area, as though protected by a forbiddance spell.
While inside her lair a crone is shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a nondetection spell.
#bp;Regional Effect
The region containing a crone lair is altered by the creature's presence, creating one or more of the following magical effects, based on the type of crone:
#is;Death Crone: Undead creatures lurk in the region. If the crone wishes so, humanoids dying in the region raise within 24 hours as foglets, drowners or other type of undead suiting the environment.
#is;Flesh Crone: Natural healing is greatly impeded in the region. When a character expands a Hit Dice to heal and obtains a "1", it cannot regain hit points by any mean until it completed a long rest or a remove curse spell ends the effect.
#is;Norn: People born in the area refuse to leave the region, tying their fate to the land. Any spell that can end a curse can remove this coercive effect.
#is;Primeval Crone: The crone can hear anything that is happening in the region through severed ears hanged in trees. Crow spies report any suspicious activity in the region to the crown.
When a crone is killed, its regional effects fades over 30 days.

#h;Norn
The enigmatic norns, also called Fates, are crones that rule and prophecy the destinies of men. They are often blamed for tragic fates, as they weave destinies to reach a dramatic ending, causing all the malevolent and tragic events in the land. Not all aspects of the norns are negative though, for they are known for visiting newborn children in order to determine his or her future. Sometimes, when a child has an exceptional destiny they will bestow freely their blessing to assure it will fulfil its fate. The curses casted by norns manipulate events in unforeseeable and tragic ways.

Every crone involved in the ritual cannot use their innate spellcasting ability until they completed a short rest.
The deed to lift the curse must be something that the target can accomplish within one year, assuming the task is undertaken immediately (burning all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, climbing the tallest mountain of the world, slaughter an entire bloodline...). Killing the crone doesn't end the curse.
The target of the elder curse can have help accomplishing the deed. In fact, someone else can accomplish the deed as long as removing the curse is the expressed purpose of the deed.
If someone who doesn’t know about the curse accomplish the deed, the curse remains.

#zl;image;Primeval Crone.png;Primeval Crone
#h;Primeval Crone
Primeval crones have an unparalleled connection with their land, they are aware of anything that happens in it thanks to their many crow spies and the ears they hang in trees. They can control the weather and command to beasts throughout their demesne. They can tame the wildest of monstrosity and make them do their bidding. They have a strong affinity with
Fiends and Chort and use them to destroy their enemy or seek the ones that attempt to escape their pact. When they curse someone they usually turn them into mindless beast, afflicting them with lycanthropy or driving them insane
#h;Crones
#bs;Ancient Monstrosity. The isolated corners of our world harbor creatures older than humans, older than academies and mages, older even than elves and dwarves. The Crones are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and, since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made daughters out of dirt and water.
#bs;Life-saving Parricide. A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of land. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals, and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land - men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, the land was drowning in blood.
The daughters saw their home nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her into a bog. Her blood watered a mystical oak, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land, and so the daughters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the earth, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.
#bs;Earthly Goddesses. Common folk refer to the crones "The Ladies of the Wood", “Norns”, or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of their land, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. In foul times, when plague or famine steals the harvest, when the gods have abandoned them, when the mighty do not care for their fate, the folks turn to the Ladies for help.
#bp;A Gift from the Ladies
If one listens to tells and stories, you will learn how to plea for help from a crone, such help always comes at a price though, but the ladies have the reputation to always keep their word. This is how one begs help from the Ladies:
Find a child, young and innocent, and search out the Ladies' shrine - that is where the Trail of Treats begins. Set the child off on the trail and it shall follow its sweet track and find the Good Ladies. The child will never want for anything ever again, for the Ladies are kind and generous. Standing before their shrine, pronounce your request and the Good Ladies will hear, for they see and hear all that takes place in their demesne. If you made the offering as it must be done, your supplication will be heard.
Such boons may include but are not limited to: ability score improvements, new feats, or epic boons found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 232). The gift lasts until the crone chooses to dismiss it or the crone dies. A wish spell can also end the pact.
A creature that makes a pact with a crone gains a mystical brand somewhere on its body, the brand is unique to each crone. The crone can communicate through the person over any distance, even from another plane of existence, speaking through its mouth. Once per month, the crone may charm the creature as if using the geas spell. The creature automatically fails the saving throw to resist the spell, and it can’t be ended by any normal magic except for a wish spell, which also ends the pact.
#bs;Fiendish Appetite. In the more ghastly legends, crones are said to know over a dozen recipes for human soup. During their sabbath crowns truly feed on human flesh, cooking men and children in infernal pots spiced with root from the cursed trees growing in their lair. In whispered tales, for if they spoke too loudly the crones would hear it, villagers speak of the tribute demanded in the form of human ears. The ears hung from trees, allowing the crones, through the use of primeval magic, to heard all that happened in their land.
#h;Elder Curse
Simple curses are easily dealt with by clerics, druids and wizards, becoming nothing more than a temporary annoyance for the wielders of the faith and arcane. However, in ancient times, magic was expressing itself differently, demanding sacrifices to be tamed, powering itself on blood, life essence and grievous trials. Elder curses tap into these ancient powers, a form of magic that is primal and raw, brutal and cruel. Such curses are not so easily dispelled and will resist most form of magic. Nothing short of a wish spell can remove an elder curse but each elder curse also must have a single means of removing the curse with some deed that the DM designates:
The elder curse must be casted by the crone as a ritual, taking an hour to perform. The effects can target one creature, without limit of distance or planar location, as long as the crone add a part of the target (strand of hair, nail clipping, blood, etc.) as a spell component, consumed during casting.
The elder curse can duplicate the effects of a bestow curse, contagion, symbol, true polymorph, or even, if several crones partake in the ritual, a wish spell (Spell DC 18, +2 per crone performing the ritual after the first). Every crone involved in the ritual cannot use their innate spellcasting ability until they completed a short rest.
The deed to lift the curse must be something that the target can accomplish within one year, assuming the task is undertaken immediately (burning all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, climbing the tallest mountain of the world, slaughter an entire bloodline...). Killing the crone doesn't end the curse.
The target of the elder curse can have help accomplishing the deed. In fact, someone else can accomplish the deed as long as removing the curse is the expressed purpose of the deed.
If someone who doesn’t know about the curse accomplish the deed, the curse remains.
#bs;Elder Magic. Crones wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from the elements and destiny and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses. The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the land in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.
#bs;Many Sisters. Although theoretically born from the same mother, crones do not necessarily like or even work with each other. Truly enough, some form covens, gather for great sabbath and maintain correspondence with distant sisters, but it is equally true that some hate each other viscerally and wage war against their brethren over feuds so ancient that none but them can remember why.

Flesh Crones are gluttonous creatures, feasting constantly on the sacrifices made in their name. They brew stews of human flesh and bake pies filled with children meat. They are physically larger and stronger than their sisters and can regenerate wounds quickly, while dealing terrible blow, dismembering their victims with a single strike. They are the ones that know the secrets of the elixir allowing them to prolong their life indefinitely. Their curses usually turn their victims into wretched beings, especially unfaithful or desperate women, twisting them into vile hags.

#zl;image;Death Crone.png;Death Crone
#h;Death Crone
Death Crones have power over death and the undead, especially the ones dying in their land. They have the ability to raise the fallen to serve them and can command to necrotic energies. Some believe that death crones gained their abilities by dealing the killing blow to their mother, binding themselves forever to murderous magic in the process. The presence of a death crones is usually felt first by the unusual number of undead roaming the area, especially drowners and foglets. Of all the crones, they are the ones that cast the nastiest curses, usually resulting in slow agonizing death
#h;Crones
#bs;Ancient Monstrosity. The isolated corners of our world harbor creatures older than humans, older than academies and mages, older even than elves and dwarves. The Crones are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and, since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made daughters out of dirt and water.
#bs;Life-saving Parricide. A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of land. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals, and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land - men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, the land was drowning in blood.
The daughters saw their home nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her into a bog. Her blood watered a mystical oak, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land, and so the daughters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the earth, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.
#bs;Earthly Goddesses. Common folk refer to the crones "The Ladies of the Wood", “Norns”, or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of their land, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. In foul times, when plague or famine steals the harvest, when the gods have abandoned them, when the mighty do not care for their fate, the folks turn to the Ladies for help.
#bp;A Gift from the Ladies
If one listens to tells and stories, you will learn how to plea for help from a crone, such help always comes at a price though, but the ladies have the reputation to always keep their word. This is how one begs help from the Ladies:
Find a child, young and innocent, and search out the Ladies' shrine - that is where the Trail of Treats begins. Set the child off on the trail and it shall follow its sweet track and find the Good Ladies. The child will never want for anything ever again, for the Ladies are kind and generous. Standing before their shrine, pronounce your request and the Good Ladies will hear, for they see and hear all that takes place in their demesne. If you made the offering as it must be done, your supplication will be heard.
Such boons may include but are not limited to: ability score improvements, new feats, or epic boons found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 232). The gift lasts until the crone chooses to dismiss it or the crone dies. A wish spell can also end the pact.
A creature that makes a pact with a crone gains a mystical brand somewhere on its body, the brand is unique to each crone. The crone can communicate through the person over any distance, even from another plane of existence, speaking through its mouth. Once per month, the crone may charm the creature as if using the geas spell. The creature automatically fails the saving throw to resist the spell, and it can’t be ended by any normal magic except for a wish spell, which also ends the pact.
#bs;Fiendish Appetite. In the more ghastly legends, crones are said to know over a dozen recipes for human soup. During their sabbath crowns truly feed on human flesh, cooking men and children in infernal pots spiced with root from the cursed trees growing in their lair. In whispered tales, for if they spoke too loudly the crones would hear it, villagers speak of the tribute demanded in the form of human ears. The ears hung from trees, allowing the crones, through the use of primeval magic, to heard all that happened in their land.
#h;Elder Curse
Simple curses are easily dealt with by clerics, druids and wizards, becoming nothing more than a temporary annoyance for the wielders of the faith and arcane. However, in ancient times, magic was expressing itself differently, demanding sacrifices to be tamed, powering itself on blood, life essence and grievous trials. Elder curses tap into these ancient powers, a form of magic that is primal and raw, brutal and cruel. Such curses are not so easily dispelled and will resist most form of magic. Nothing short of a wish spell can remove an elder curse but each elder curse also must have a single means of removing the curse with some deed that the DM designates:
The elder curse must be casted by the crone as a ritual, taking an hour to perform. The effects can target one creature, without limit of distance or planar location, as long as the crone add a part of the target (strand of hair, nail clipping, blood, etc.) as a spell component, consumed during casting.
The elder curse can duplicate the effects of a bestow curse, contagion, symbol, true polymorph, or even, if several crones partake in the ritual, a wish spell (Spell DC 18, +2 per crone performing the ritual after the first). Every crone involved in the ritual cannot use their innate spellcasting ability until they completed a short rest.
The deed to lift the curse must be something that the target can accomplish within one year, assuming the task is undertaken immediately (burning all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, climbing the tallest mountain of the world, slaughter an entire bloodline...). Killing the crone doesn't end the curse.
The target of the elder curse can have help accomplishing the deed. In fact, someone else can accomplish the deed as long as removing the curse is the expressed purpose of the deed.
If someone who doesn’t know about the curse accomplish the deed, the curse remains.
#bs;Elder Magic. Crones wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from the elements and destiny and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses. The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the land in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.
#bs;Many Sisters. Although theoretically born from the same mother, crones do not necessarily like or even work with each other. Truly enough, some form covens, gather for great sabbath and maintain correspondence with distant sisters, but it is equally true that some hate each other viscerally and wage war against their brethren over feuds so ancient that none but them can remember why. The simple truth is that crones are very unique individuals, and that no simple rule can define their complex relationships.
#h;A Crone's Lair
A crone's lair isn't usually where she lives, but a mystical center of energy, usually tied to the death of its mother. It holds great significance and importance in the performing of her magic. Sabbaths, seasonal rites and other ceremonial sacrifices are held at the lair or in close vicinity.
#bp;Lair Traits
A crone's lair has all of the following effects in place:
A crone can only cast an elder curse or control a creature that made a pact with her from within her lair. Creatures other than the crone can’t teleport into the lair or use portals and planar travel to enter the area, as though protected by a forbiddance spell.
While inside her lair a crone is shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a nondetection spell.
#bp;Regional Effect
The region containing a crone lair is altered by the creature's presence, creating one or more of the following magical effects, based on the type of crone:
#is;Death Crone: Undead creatures lurk in the region. If the crone wishes so, humanoids dying in the region raise within 24 hours as foglets, drowners or other type of undead suiting the environment.
#is;Flesh Crone: Natural healing is greatly impeded in the region. When a character expands a Hit Dice to heal and obtains a "1", it cannot regain hit points by any mean until it completed a long rest or a remove curse spell ends the effect.
#is;Norn: People born in the area refuse to leave the region, tying their fate to the land. Any spell that can end a curse can remove this coercive effect.
#is;Primeval Crone: The crone can hear anything that is happening in the region through severed ears hanged in trees. Crow spies report any suspicious activity in the region to the crown.
When a crone is killed, its regional effects fades over 30 days.

#h;Gorebull
Great was the blood letting that day! The ice became red slush for a league or more. The minotaurs went mad with it, shrieking at the sky. Some of them, they drop their axes and leap on my fellows, biting off limbs and heads with their teeth. We cut them bad, sliced them open and still they would not stop eating the spilt gore. Dere is no wit in their heads when the blood song sings, only the desire to maim and eat. Several of my cousins and one of my brothers died like this. He died screaming. It was not a good death. —Holger Algersson, Norse Mercenary.
#bs;Gore and Violence. Gorebulls are the leaders of a minotaur tribe, and though they may not be as strong or favored as a Chosen of Baphomet, they are nonetheless ferocious behemoths clad in powerful armor and hefty war-axes. When the time is right, when the hour has come to enter the labyrinth, the Gorebulls roar out a bellowing call that resounds around the forest for many miles, attracting yet more minotaurs and invoking the bloodgreed that runs through all of their kind.
#bs;Primal Call. Soon the forest will echo to the thunder of gargantuan hooves as minotaurs gather by the dozens at the labyrinth gate, pawing the ground in their haste to trample and crush. Consumed by bloodgreed after the ritual, the minotaurs lay waste to their prey in an orgy of slaughter, smashing through barricades and buildings alike to get at the still-living weaklings that cower within. It is not only minotaurs who heed the call of the bloodgreed, for sometimes druidic circles or totemic barbarians will be swept up in the rush of primal instinct to fight and to feed. The gorebull at the head of the homed army lowers his head and charges at full speed towards any who defies him, gouging his horns deep into the foe and maiming everything within reach with its axes. When all is laid to waste the minotaur gorges itself on the choicest of prey while his followers fight over the corpse-harvest at their feet

#zl;image;Chosen.png;Chosen of Baphomet
#h;Chosen of Baphomet
#bs;Lord of Carnage. Chosen of Baphomet, also known as Bloodcallers, the Fathers of Rage or simply as Minotaur Lords are the strongest and most ferocious of all minotaurs, towering bull-headed and cloven-hoofed beasts almost as broad as they are tall. Little more intelligent than their lesser kin, they are instead set above others of their kind by the sheer animal intensity of their hunger for flesh, and their inherent ability to invoke this intense bloodlust in others. As with human champions, a chosen of Baphomet may swear allegiance to the demon lord and this is often reflected in their appearance. Chosen of Baphomet often have red-tinged flesh and fur, and their horns are sheathed in heavy brass. They decorate their bodies with many gory trophies, and jewelry looted from others is hammered into their bare flesh and hung on their horns.
#bs;Leader of the Herd. Though no master of strategy or battle doctrine, a chosen of Baphomet is capable of leadership, of a sort. It is he that bellows the raw will of the Horned King, triggering a terrifying stampede that can only end when the horde's unnatural thirst is quenched with the blood of men. As the chosen’s army smashes its way through the dark woods, the undergrowth is flattened and trees toppled all around. This is a truly horrifying sight for the occupants of any settlement in its path, for it spells certain and violent death. Yet even forewarned by the cacophony of the stampede's approach, the defenders of such fortifications are truly doomed, for the chosen of Baphomet and his minotaurs will be upon them in short order.

#zl;image;Grave Hag.png;Grave Hag
#h;Grave Hag
#bs;Deformed Scavenger. Few monsters' names fit as well as the grave hags'. As one might guess, these creatures resemble aged, deformed women and loiter near graveyards and battlefields. Grave hags feed on human corpses and in particular on the rotten marrow which they slurp from human bones using their long, prehensile tongues. Most grave hags rarely attack humans, preferring instead to feed on the rotten remains they dig out of graves. Yet some individuals grow bold over the years and begin sneaking into huts to steal children and kill the elderly. Once a hag has devoured all corpses within reach, she turns to killing men and burying them in the cemetery as she waits for them to decompose or raise them as servants.
#bs;Child Killer. Grave Hags are notorious child killers, making them one of the most despised monster there is. They typically kidnap wandering children or sneak in their home at night, attracted by their innocence, glowing like a beacon in the dark for them. After they ate a child, they then use its remains as magical focus, building altars of little bones to practice their magic. The skull of a child is of special importance to them, as they craft powerful talismans with it, enslaving its soul. Some hags are even known to strap the entire skeleton of the child on their back, wearing it as a protection charm.
#bs;Territorial Shrew. Grave hags are territorial and aggressive when provoked, they will put up a fierce fight, using their great speed to rapidly close on prey. The tongue of a grave hag can surprise even veteran fighter with the speed and range it can lash out. Being struck by it can cause temporary blindness, or even paralysis, leaving the victim unable to properly defend themselves. The claws of a grave hag are sharp, but not enough that skilled swordplay cannot defend against them.
#bs;Covens. Grave hags rarely join covens, as the magic they practice is more akin to necromancy. When they do, they often try to lead the rituals, bickering with Night Hags about every details, which they have an especially hard time to get along with. A grave hag that is part of a coven (see the “Hag Covens sidebar” p.176 of the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP).
#h;Grave Hag Items
A grave hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself. If either object is lost, the grave hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.
#bs;Ebon Skull. This burned black skull allows a grave hag to use her Twist the Innocent power while it is in her possession. A creature holding the skull can use an action to cast the speak with dead spell to communicate with the dead child. Crafting an ebon skull takes 10 days and the sacrifice of a humanoid child (whose skull is used to make the item).
#bs;Hand of Glory. A grave hag can craft a hand of glory out of the hand of an elderly humanoid. While the item is in her possession she can use her Command Undead feature. Only the grave hag who crafted the hand of glory can use its power. Crafting a hand of glory takes 30 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose hand is used to craft the item.
#h;Eerie Pipe
This singular looking pipe is carved in the ribcage bones of a child. When used by any other creature than a grave hag it acts as a pipe of the sewers, but when in the hands of the hag, it reveals new powers. The hag can play an eerie tune from the pipe as an action, expanding a charge and creating the following effects:
The tune can only be heard by humanoid children and creatures with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Only humanoid children are affected by the eerie pipe. Children that are deafened, cannot be charmed or can’t be put to sleep with magic are immune to the pipe’s effects.
While the pipe is played, all children within half a mile of it (as determined by the DM) are called. Called children move toward the music by the shortest available route.
Whenever children come within 30 feet of the hag while it plays the pipes, the children are swayed by the pipes' music and become charmed, acting friendly toward the hag for as long as it continue to play the pipes each round as an action. Charmed children obey the hag’s commands, even if they are obviously suicidal (“jump by that cliff, walk in this river…”). If no command is issued to a charmed child, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a charmed child starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, it is no longer charmed and behaves as it normally would. After that the child can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

Agile Flyer. The great cockatrice can fly in spaces that would allow a creature of Medium size to do so. While it is airborne its AC increases by 2 and if the cockatrice is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
Fragile Inner Ear. The cockatrice's balance can easily be thrown off by loud sounds. If the great cockatrice takes thunder damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its flying speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. An airborne cockatrice affected by this effect descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground.
Paralyzing Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the great cockatrice and the two of them can see each other, the cockatrice can force the creature to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the cockatrice isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the targeted creature is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Actions
Multiattack. The cockatrice makes three melee attacks: one with its beak, one with its talons and one with its wings and tail.
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against being magically petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.
Talons. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.
Wings and Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target has disadvantage on attack rolls based on Strength and Dexterity until the end of its next turn.

#h;Great Cockatrice
"Had meself eight heifers, five of 'em milchers. Then this cockatrice sprung up nearby, and now all's I got left's dried patties in an empty field."— Jethro, peasant from Pindal
#bs;Greater Cousin. The great cockatrice is a large creature with the body of a beast and the head and legs of a rooster. Supposedly, they are born of eggs laid by roosters consorting with other roosters, the eggs must then be incubated for forty-four days by a toad. Asserting such claims proves difficult at best. Scholars cannot help but notice the similarity with their smaller cousins and instead theorize that the great cockatrice is the true form of the species, while the more common variation a diminished, flawed, subspecies. Great cockatrices do lay eggs of their own, but for some puzzling reason, only small cockatrices ever hatch from them. Regardless, the eggs hold great value as alchemical components, for they are the prime ingredient of an ointment that can cure petrification.
#bs;Recklessly Agressive. Great cockatrices are extremely aggressive, attacking anything that comes in their sight with furious cackles, even without any provocation. These omnivores have a diet that consists of large quantities of berries, corns, fruits, and animals such as cattle, deer and the occasional lost shepherd. If left unchecked, they also greatly appreciate feasting in orchards, corn fields or any place where food is abundant. Cockatrices thrive in dark caves, abandoned ruins, cobwebbed dungeons and old basements.
Though small compared to griffins and manticores, they are more than capable of killing anyone who stumbles across them in a dark corridor.
#bs;Deadly Gaze. Folktales claim that cockatrices hate everything that lives so fiercely that its glance turns the living to stone. This is not actually true, but the eyes of the beast can paralyze anyone that look at it, which might be where the confusion in the myth is coming from. However, one should watch out for its sharp beak which carries the murderous effect, turning a man into stone with a simple scratch. It is also thought that a cockatrice will die instantly upon hearing a rooster crow, which is pure nonsense, but the cockatrice seems to hate the sound nonetheless.
#bs;Agile Flyer. Cockatrices do not shun direct fights, in which they strike furiously with wings and tail in an attempt to exhaust their foes. However, the cockatrice isn’t a stupid adversary, it is quite aware of the chaos its gaze and its beak can cause in a fight. Against multiple adversaries, it will weaken its foes with its gaze and dive attacks first, before landing and engaging in melee. When fighting them one should target their delicate wings, for they are extremely agile flyers, capable of maneuvering in tight spaces and feats of agility that most creatures of their size are incapable of.
#h;Crow of the Rooster
The cockatrice has an irrational hatred for the rooster's crow. The song of the bird will make it mad with anger and the creature will charge in the direction of the noise, furiously cackling its discontentment and ravaging anything that stands in its path. For this reason, villages around a cockatrice hunting ground tend to have no chicken, for fear of angering the monster. Clever adventurers can use this hatred to their advantage, forcing the monster to show on a battlefield of their choice or distracting it during a fight.
#h;Great Cockatrice's Eggs
The eggs of a greater cockatrice are known to be one of the few remedies besides magic that can cure petrification. Combined with other rare ingredients and plants, it can be used to make a ointment that will return a creature to its true form.
Stone to Flesh Ointment: A character that has proficiency with Alchemist's Tools or Herbalism Kit, and access to the proper equipment, can prepare an ointment with the great cockatrice egg. The ointment has a value of 200gp when it comes to crafting (see crafting rules p.187 of the Player's Handbook). Once applied to the skin of the petrified creature, the ointment will be turning it back to flesh in an hour.

#h;Griffin
#bs;Mountain Hunter. Griffins were once only found high in the mountains, where they would hunt marmots and wild goats.
When humans encroached on their lands, however, griffins soon discovered a new source of much more plentiful and easier-caught prey: cows, sheep and shepherds, though they are still wary of main roads and towns (where fold with the means to hire a party of adventurers are likely to dwell).
Griffins prefer their meat raw and screaming, though they'll scavenge if no other prey presents itself. This is fairly rare, though, as their hunting grounds tend to range for hundreds of miles around their chosen mountain aerie. Their eyesight is a sharp as raptors and they can see motion from miles away.
#bs;Fierce and Merciless. Griffins are often mistaken for the smaller griffon, which whom they share general features with. They are also significantly larger and stronger than the classic griffon, their lesser cousin. Their bone structure differ as well, with a morphology more akin to that of a wyvern, having long feathery wings ending with deadly claws. It is impossible to tame a griffin in the way griffons can be, for they are far more cunning and rebellious, with a strong sense of vengeance and grief. Skilled and efficient fighters, griffins do not kill indiscriminately, although they show no reluctance when hunting or protecting their territory. They are fierce and merciless, but rarely cruel.
#bs;Loyal Partner. Griffins, to the contrary of griffons, are solitary creatures. Until they reach full maturity they live in isolated territories and do not interact with other members of their species. Once they are ready they find a mate to found a nest, and stay loyal for life to their partner, raising their young together. There is nothing worse than a griffin that lost its partner, for they will slaughter everything they encounter, mad with grief. The eggs, claws and feathers of griffins are frequently use as spell components for they carry strong healing abilities. It is said that the feather, or claw in some tales, of a griffin will turn black if exposed to poison, a property that most king would find appealing for their safety.
#bs;Gracious and Deadly. Survivors of griffin attacks often have dreams of being hunted down and rent limb from limb for years afterward. Despite being large and monstrous creatures, griffins have reputations as noble beasts. This is in part due to their proud and regal bearing – griffins are not ravenous and frenetic like manticores. Instead a griffin strikes with swift and precise grace, its motion poised and controlled. Yet this elegance in no way undermines its deadliness, for a griffin is more than capable of using its talons and razor beak to rip a foe apart. The cry of a griffin is often enough to send enemies running. For the griffin, this is an ideal situation as it prefers its meals on the run, and alive.
They can roar at such a high pitch that even a grown man can be put off balance. From the sky, griffins try to repeatedly claw their targets as they sweep past, or attempt to dive and grab their prey, leading it to a deadly fall.

#h;Royal Griffin
#bs;Noble Beast. Especially feared are the subspecies known as royal griffins or archgriffins. Royal griffins owe their name to the broad and thick mane that surrounds their head. Their plumage range from brown to black, snow white in cold areas or almost red in arid regions. A royal griffin distinguishes itself by its increased aggressivity, stouter frame and its majestic presence, a rare and unexplained ability that will put doubt into the heart of even the most dedicated hunter.
#bs;Fearsome Predator. Archgriffins represent a real threat for civilization, for they are not afraid to hunt in small towns and trade routes, where preys, people mostly, are abundant. Royal griffins have few natural predators and are not afraid to attack preys bigger than them, sometimes even hunting gigantic roc birds, small dragons or giants for sustenance.
Surprisingly the feathers of a royal griffin makes it immune to extreme temperatures, allowing it to live under the searing sun of the desert or in arctic climate.
#bp;Griffin Claw
Wondrous item, rare
This claw is coming from the wing of a griffin. When you hold it in your hand you can use an action to cast the detect poison and disease spell for 1 hour at will and gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition for the same duration. The claw turns black when it detects poison or disease. After the hour passes the claw loses all magic properties.
#h;Optional : Noble Beast
Very few people know that griffin are nicknamed “noble beast” for a reason. Most think it refers to their natural grace or the king-mane of a royal griffin, but in truth griffins are susceptible to overt demonstration of respect. If one is unlucky enough to stumble on a griffin, one should not draw its sword but instead bow very low, pointing its eyes at the ground. If the beast isn’t hungry and the gesture is properly executed the creature will answer with a singular bow of its wings, leaving the area peacefully. This of course bears a significant risk, for there is usually no sure way to tell if the beast fed recently or is in the right mood.

#zl;image;Crypt Horror.png;Crypt Horror
#h;Necrophage
Crypt horrors are a variation of the common ghouls who have consumed the blood of a vampire, giving the creature an increased in supernatural size and strength. The malformed monstrosities known as crypt horrors are, thankfully, a rare sight. Spoken of in hushed whispers by night watchmen, old priests, grave-keepers and other nocturnal citizens, the few persistent reports of these looming and moon-mad fiends are dismissed as the ravings of superstitious fools. At best, they are thought to be exaggerated sightings of unnaturally large ghouls or ghast. Unfortunately for the mortal world, the stories are often accurate, for crypt horrors are very real.
#bs;Bloody Ascension. Once a ghoul has drunk the blood of a Vampire, its eyes turn red and it goes into a killing frenzy. During this stage in its transformation, the crypt horror would pull down weaker members of its own pack, dragging its screeching prey into an open grave or a shattered tomb in order to consume its gruesome feast undisturbed. After finishing its cannibalistic orgy, the swollen ghoul will crawl back to its awaiting master, hoping for another draught of its vampiric blood. This transformation continues until by the coming of the next full moon, the new crypt horror will have grown to several times its original size and ferocity, thanks to the unnatural blood of the vampire and the consumption of extraordinary amounts of flesh.
#bs;Frenzied Monstrosity. In battle, Crypt Horrors muscle their way towards the front lines, eyes glowing with dire light. They use shattered gravestones, tomb statuary and cemetery railings to smash aside those brave enough to stand before them, but it is their meat-encrusted fangs and talons that are to be avoided at all costs. Even a shallow wound from a Crypt Horror bears enough poisonous rot to kill a horse. One daunting fact about crypt horrors is their ability to resist most form of conventional protection against the undead. They can pass the sacred seals protecting unviolated burial crypts without as much as a shudder, or step into hallowed ground without any difficulty. The energies animating them even make them immune to the turning ability of the most powerful priests. Despised by the living and the dead alike, Crypt Horrors are creatures to be truly feared.
#bs;Titanic Brute. A crypt horror typically towers over its smaller ghoul brethren, and though it retains the characteristic stoop and loping gait of its former life, its sinews become hard as iron. Bony growths and protrusions push out from the creature's spine, and talons lengthen from splayed, dextrous hands. The potent diet of tough ghoul flesh washed down with vampiric blood wreaks changes inside as well as out. Though the crypt horror's freakish metabolism will soon drive the creature's body to consume itself, in the meantime, the fiend's constitution is such that it can reknit even the most horrific wound with little effort. This is the main reason why the more elitist vampire cliques tolerate these foul monsters. Dark magic, the sustaining power of necromancy, literally runs in a crypt ghoul's veins, and therefore the sheer violence it can unleash is not to be underestimated.

#h;Drowner
When at the water's edge, you gotta be quiet. First of all, so as not to scare the fish. Second — so you don't attract drowners.''— Yanneck of Blaviken, fisherman
#bs;Watery Death. Sometimes a drowned man returns as a monster, to haunt the living. Such creature is called a drowner and resembles a corpse dredged from the bottom of a pond. Skinny and humped, with its huge head, slightly protruding belly and concave chest, the drowner became a creature that is half-scary, half grotesque. Its eyes are round and fishlike, granting it a rather dumb expression. It also has wide palms and membranes between its fingers as well as a fin. A Drowner lives underwater and is awkward when on dry land... It is sickly blue or green in color, with slime and sludge oozing out of every pore and the acrid stench of rot wafting off of it. That is why drowners – along with their more dangerous cousins: vodniks, mucknixers and drowned dead – arise from the bodies of those who drown in shallow water: lost travelers falling into bogs, children who swim too far from the shore or, in the case of vodniks, inebriated peasants who stumble off narrow swamp trails.
#bs;Pack Hunter. Drowners are predominantly pack creatures by nature, usually hunting in groups of three or greater. Once they have spotted a prey, they will burrow into the ground. This is a sure warning sign that they’re preparing an ambush and will try to leap at a prey from beneath the ground. One should always watch for disturbances at its feet when in a swamp. Individually drowners are not much of a threat, but they can become quite dangerous when attacking in pack. Aside from their numbers, their attacks are quite fast and can have surprising range as they usually do leaping jump-strikes; above all else, one should never let itself get surrounded by them. Drowners react to the deaths of their fellows by screaming in pain. This show of mourning leaves them defenseless for several seconds. As they are already dead, drowners do not fear poisons, and even a large loss of blood makes no impression on them.
#bs;Stalking Scavenger. Drowners are quite often found at the banks of huge river with regular shipping and riverside villages provides them with ample sustenance. Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators. If not particularly hungry at the moment, they will keep their prey under the water for a few days, aging it until it grows deliciously tender and rotten. Drowners are particularly active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling, at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland.
#h;Drowned Dead
Particularly strong and dangerous drowners are known as drowned dead, vodniks and mucknixers. Simple people see no difference between the drowner and the drowned dead — encountering either of them is equally deadly. We might suppose, though, that the most gloomy legends pretending they can make you drown in the middle of a desert concern the drowned dead rather than drowners.
Drowned dead arise from the corpse of an executed criminal tossed into the water, while vodniks are the corpses of drowned drunkards. Mucknixers are far rarer, for they come from a necromantic ritual where the victim is purposely drowned to rise as an undead.

If night ever catches you in the swamps, stay put and wait for dawn, even if it means standing waist-deep in water with leeches crawling down your trousers. Most important of all, if you see a light in the fog, never, and I mean never, go towards it. — Johannes Strudd, guide
#bs;Lurker in the Fog. Fog is the traveler's foe. In the forest, it can make one lose one's way, at sea, it can send one sailing into the rocks. Yet such dangers are nothing compared to the monsters known as foglets which sometimes lurk within it. These creatures have powerful arms and claws, yet what makes them truly dangerous is their mastery of deception, beguilement and disorientation. Many times they need not attack at all, instead simply driving their prey to madness or into boggy marshlands, after which they wait patiently for it to drown in the muddy waters.
#bs;Dark Soul. Like ghastly glowworms, their bodies emit a pale light they use to lure those lost in the fog towards the ravines, swamps or caves in which they make their lairs. Legends say that foglets are will-o’-wisps coming from the soul of truly despicable killers. After a time, once they consumed enough life force, they inhabit a corpse and twist it into a monstrous foglet, becoming material and free to kill once more. In parts of the world where the evil lights are common occurrences, cultures tend to practice cremation as a funeral rites, to prevent corpse to be inhabited by these spirits. 
#bs;Eerie Land. Foglets can appear wherever thick fog arises: swamplands, mountain passes or the shores of rivers and lakes. If no fog is forthcoming, they can create or summon it themselves. By manipulating fog they can separate travelers from each other, hide trails and deafen noise. While foglets can disappear at will, watching for moving patches of fog or grass swaying in a path leading directly to their victims is one way to identify their location.
#bs;Vicious Fighter. Rapidly thickening fog tends to be a sign that foglets are close. When fighting foglets, an adventurer must remain calm and keep his wits about him no matter what. Since foglets can take on immaterial form, a slight shimmer of air or a rustle in the grass might be the only clues an adventurer has to their location. Foglets create illusions of themselves that can cause physical harm, while the real foglet stalks the area.

Yet such dangers are nothing compared to the monsters known as foglets which sometimes lurk within it. These creatures have powerful arms and claws, yet what makes them truly dangerous is their mastery of deception, beguilement and disorientation. Many times they need not attack at all, instead simply driving their prey to madness or into boggy marshlands, after which they wait patiently for it to drown in the muddy waters.
#bs;Dark Soul. Like ghastly glowworms, their bodies emit a pale light they use to lure those lost in the fog towards the ravines, swamps or caves in which they make their lairs. Legends say that foglets are will-o’-wisps coming from the soul of truly despicable killers. After a time, once they consumed enough life force, they inhabit a corpse and twist it into a monstrous foglet, becoming material and free to kill once more. In parts of the world where the evil lights are common occurrences, cultures tend to practice cremation as a funeral rites, to prevent corpse to be inhabited by these spirits. 
#bs;Eerie Land. Foglets can appear wherever thick fog arises: swamplands, mountain passes or the shores of rivers and lakes. If no fog is forthcoming, they can create or summon it themselves. By manipulating fog they can separate travelers from each other, hide trails and deafen noise. While foglets can disappear at will, watching for moving patches of fog or grass swaying in a path leading directly to their victims is one way to identify their location.
#bs;Vicious Fighter. Rapidly thickening fog tends to be a sign that foglets are close. When fighting foglets, an adventurer must remain calm and keep his wits about him no matter what. Since foglets can take on immaterial form, a slight shimmer of air or a rustle in the grass might be the only clues an adventurer has to their location. Foglets create illusions of themselves that can cause physical harm, while the real foglet stalks the area.
#h;Ignis Fatuus
Particularly old and vicious foglets are called ignis fatuus. Over their long existence they have mastered the art of trickery and can dissimulate their lair through intricate illusions. They will often attract other wicked souls, will-o’- wisp, and have the ability to summon a deadly lingering fog.
#h;Ignis Fatuus's Lair
Ignis Fatuus make their lair is deep cave networks or abandoned keeps. They usually pick places with strong magical connection, like places of power or wild magic, somehow feeding on its energy.
#bp;Regional Effect
The region containing an ignis fatuus is tainted by the creature's presence, creating the following magical effects:
Patches of thick fog roll over the countryside at all time, carrying a strong metallic smell. The area is heavily obscured and creatures are unable to breathe within it. A wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it for an hour.
People easily become lost in the region. All Wisdom (Survival) checks are made with disadvantage. Creatures that cannot be charmed are unaffected.
Will-o'-wisps gather in the region, congregating like moth around a flame.
When the ignis fatuus is destroyed, all of these regional effects fade instantly.

Course it reeks. Think they're called rotfiends because they smell like roses? — Vesemir, witcher of the Wolf School
#bs;Skinless Rotter. What rotfiends are, everyone can see. Even seeing them is not necessary, as hearing their name should be enough to tell anyone what creatures might bear this unpleasant title. Rotfiends resemble decomposing human bodies that have been mostly stripped of their skin. Their presence is given away by the overwhelming stench of the rot which gives them their name.
#bs;Pack Scavenger. Similar to ghouls, rotfiends roam in packs. Rotfiends are undead, so usual tactics against this kind of creature might apply. Common poisons, on the other hand, are useless - the beasts have gained immunity to these by devouring carcasses. Killing a rotfiend is not difficult, yet one must remember to survive the moment of the beast's death, for the monster's corpse releases explosive fumes a mere spark could ignite. The resulting explosion can easily kill an adventurer, but it might also kill nearby rotfiends, creating something of a chain reaction. Thus, a dying monster should be drawn away from its kin.
#bs;Hysterical Strength. Backed against a wall, a rotfiend flies into a fury, attacking madly. This attack should be evaded, for the beast's chaotic blows carry a strength that can only be called hysterical. Running is never a good idea when fighting rotfiends, as the creatures will pursue their foe, jump on his back, knock him down and overwhelm him. Stopping rotfiends from escaping can be difficult as they try to burrow into the ground.
#h;Flesh Rot (see contagion spell)
Many academies throughout the world have studied the remains of rotfiends, hoping to explain their sudden and recurrent return. They have yet to find the answer to their question but one troubling fact might lead them on the right path: the corrupted tissues of the undead always reveal the presence of the flesh rot disease. Most concluded that the two phenomena are inherently connected: a flesh rot outburst is followed by a resurgence of rotfiends and rotfiend infestations are always followed by numerous cases of the disease.
Alternatively, a creature that takes damage from a rotfiend must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, contracting the flesh rot disease on failure, as per the contagion spell.
#bs;Unwelcomed Resurgence. Rotfiends and devourers were once rarities, but in age of constant warfare and violence they can become a veritable plague, as they feed on carrion and human corpses, particularly around battlefields, near cities afflicted by plague, or around villages touched by famine.
They appear of a sudden, and disappear even more quickly if threatened, so exterminating them is difficult. They are best dealt with by cutting off their food supply, which is, burning all corpses in the area. Corpses must be incinerated rather than buried, for rotfiends are avid and skillful diggers.
Without sustenance, the beasts will leave in search of new feeding grounds. See a rotfiend and you can be sure there are many more in the area. They usually feed in large groups and thus present a danger to lone travelers – especially considering their speed, which can be more than a match for a horse at full gallop. Rotfiends and devourers feed in the twilight hours and at night, when they become much more dangerous than during the day.
#h;Devourer
Devourers are a particularly dangerous kind of rotfiend marked by an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Most folktales on rotfied suggest that once a rotfiend tasted the flesh of a living humanoid it will turn into a devourer, craving the flesh of the living rather that of the dead. There is no distinguishable hierarchy in the rotfiend pack, but devourers are without question the best at finding and digging corpses, and so the rest of the pack follows them wherever they go.

#bs;Vicious Ambusher. Imagine a drowner that burrows tunnels, climbs trees, is more vicious than usual, and when ambushing its prey, it does so with many of its kin. Now you have a good idea of what a nekker is. These primitive fey creatures are the bane of the wilderness and found in numbers across the world, preferably near roads. The inhabitants of forest villages fear them, and animals give their nests a wide berth. Nekkers typically live in cave networks with maze of tunnels giving access to the surface, where they can easily retreat if things turn sour. Some particularly bold nests will extend their tunnel to inside a settlement, harassing the inhabitants day and night.
#bs;Tribal Society. Nekkers are social creatures, gathering in something akin to tribes, for they can only repel the attacks of stronger assailants with sheer numbers. They use war paints to establish social status, and will occasionally fashion tribal icons out of bones, wood and razorvine, which they seem particularly found of. When nekkers venture out as a war or hunting party, they are led by thornhearts, their prophets and leaders. Thornhearts give orders, turning a wild band into an organized unit, thus they should be eliminated first. As malicious as they are, nekkers are cowardly creatures by nature and will not hesitate to flee if too many of them are slaughtered or an opponent seems too dangerous. This obviously changes when a thornheart is leading the tribe, exalting them.
#bs;Innocence Lost. Legends say that the nekkers were once gentle and playful fey, living quietly in the realm of Arcadia. A powerful Archfey, known only as the Lady of Thorns, twisted their entire race and turn them into the vicious and pesky beings they are today. The Lady used the nekker to find and trick children with the spark of magic to wander into the Feywild, never to be seen again. Some say the Lady was a crone or hag, keeping herself alive by feeding on the children, other legends pretend that she was a dryad queen. Nobody knows who the Lady really was and what happened to her. None have heard of her in centuries, still, the nekkers remain, doing her biding.
#bs;Overwhelming Swarm. A lone nekker is harmless. Five are dangerous. Ten can kill even a veteran monster slayer. Individual nekkers are weak, easy marks compared to other monsters; Nekkers do not tend to fight as individuals. One must be ready to repel many foes at once. If you see one, expect anywhere from 2-10 more. They burrow from beneath the ground or fall from trees and swarm upon their prey.
Though primitive, the tactic is surprisingly effective. Nekkers overwhelm their targets through sheer numbers, surrounding them, then pummeling and clawing victims to death. Even veteran adventurers can fall prey to this. When facing large groups of nekkers, it is best to take advantage of tactics that can harm several opponents at once, such as spells and explosives that can help thin out the swarm with ease. As with other agile creatures, running from nekkers is not the best idea, for the monsters will catch up to their prey and swiftly kill it with multiple hits of their claws.

If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose 2 (1d4) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to internal injuries. Each time the nekker hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 2 (1d4). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
Reactions
Escape. The nekker adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the nekker must see the attacker. If the attack misses, the nekker can move from half its burrowing speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

#h;Phoocas
Phoocas are a strange breed of nekker that seem to have an irrational hatred for every creature with a spark of magic, to the exception of thornhearts that they revere like prophets. They are fierce hunters and have the ability to drain the energy from spells, leaving spellcasters vulnerable to their vicious claws. Phoocas paint their body in dark green or brown colors, while practicing some sort of ritual scarification, piercing their skin with razorvine thorns.
Phoocas are somewhat the magpies of the nekkers; they steal any magic item they can get their hands on, going to great length and danger to acquire them. They always bring their prize deep inside the nekker’s burrow, offering it reverently to thornhearts. Mages learn to protect their studies against these intruders, for hiring parties of adventurers to recover prized possessions becomes quickly more than an annoyance.

#h;Thornheart
During rare astrological events, when the barrier between the Feywild and the Material world is thinning, the nekkers will venture into settlements, led by phoocas, looking for children with the spark of magic in them. Tragedies usually follow, as the nekkers swarm slaughters the entire village and every mage, priest or druid they can find. The children found are taken to the Thorn Garden, a fey crossing at the deepest point of the nekker’s burrow, filled with deadly razorvines. During a strange ceremony, the heart of the children are pierced with a Thornshard, one of the many magical thorns that used to be part of the Lady of Thorn’s dress, a sacred item for the nekkers. The ones that survive turn into nekkers known as thornhearts, wielding a fraction of the Lady’s power.
Thornhearts are seen as prophets and heralds by the nekkers, revered as priests of the Lady. They are thought to one day find again the Lady of Thorn. Thornhearts are larger and have more expressive faces than regular nekkers, akin to the innocent face of a child. The thorn in their heart is clearly visible, pulsating with magic. They have some basic understanding of fate magic, wielding a form of raw primitive power. These abilities makes them natural leaders of their race, channeling their inner strength to inspire their cowardly kin to daring feats. Thornhearts often wear jewelry made of bones & razorvines, and mark their faces with blue and green pigments.
#h;Thornheart's Lair
A thornheart lair is located deep underground, after a maze of tunnels and caves leading to a place called the Thorn Garden, a crossing to the Feywild surrounded by deadly razorvine and beautiful eerie lights.
#bp;Lair Traits
A thornheart's lair might have any or all of the following effects in place:
Razorvines (p.110 Dungeon Master's Guide) are growing unpredictably and uncontrollably fast in the lair and its surrounding.
Hallucinogenic spores float in the air. Every breathing creature that spends more than 10 minutes in the lair without protection against inhaled poison must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. While poisoned the creature suffers from a random long-term madness (p.260 Dungeon Master’s Guide). Fey and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait are immune to the spores.
A fey crossing, a portal connecting to the Feywild known as the Thorn Garden, lies at the bottom of the burrow, surrounded by razorvines, roots and eerie lights.
If the thornheart is killed, these effects fade over 10 days.

#h;Thornheart
During rare astrological events, when the barrier between the Feywild and the Material world is thinning, the nekkers will venture into settlements, led by phoocas, looking for children with the spark of magic in them. Tragedies usually follow, as the nekkers swarm slaughters the entire village and every mage, priest or druid they can find. The children found are taken to the Thorn Garden, a fey crossing at the deepest point of the nekker’s burrow, filled with deadly razorvines. During a strange ceremony, the heart of the children are pierced with a Thornshard, one of the many magical thorns that used to be part of the Lady of Thorn’s dress, a sacred item for the nekkers. The ones that survive turn into nekkers known as thornhearts, wielding a fraction of the Lady’s power.
Thornhearts are seen as prophets and heralds by the nekkers, revered as priests of the Lady. They are thought to one day find again the Lady of Thorn. Thornhearts are larger and have more expressive faces than regular nekkers, akin to the innocent face of a child. The thorn in their heart is clearly visible, pulsating with magic. They have some basic understanding of fate magic, wielding a form of raw primitive power. These abilities makes them natural leaders of their race, channeling their inner strength to inspire their cowardly kin to daring feats. Thornhearts often wear jewelry made of bones & razorvines, and mark their faces with blue and green pigments.
#h;Thornheart's Lair
A thornheart lair is located deep underground, after a maze of tunnels and caves leading to a place called the Thorn Garden, a crossing to the Feywild surrounded by deadly razorvine and beautiful eerie lights.
#bp;Lair Traits
A thornheart's lair might have any or all of the following effects in place:
Razorvines (p.110 Dungeon Master's Guide) are growing unpredictably and uncontrollably fast in the lair and its surrounding.
Hallucinogenic spores float in the air. Every breathing creature that spends more than 10 minutes in the lair without protection against inhaled poison must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. While poisoned the creature suffers from a random long-term madness (p.260 Dungeon Master’s Guide). Fey and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait are immune to the spores.
A fey crossing, a portal connecting to the Feywild known as the Thorn Garden, lies at the bottom of the burrow, surrounded by razorvines, roots and eerie lights.
If the thornheart is killed, these effects fade over 10 days.

#ip;"We saw its approach through the darkened eaves, now crawling in the dirt, now flapping upwards, as if it could not decide if it was a snake or a sparrow. Then it came into the moonlight and we saw it true. Did we fight? I cannot say. All I recall is clotted fur and an embracing drool. The stench of cadavers and burning honey. My eyes screamed, my tongue shook, my knees spewed. It ate my friends and drank my soul. It took my mind I know not where, for it is no longer here with me"— Interview with sole survivor of Reikwald forest patrol, incarcerated in Frederheim Sanitorium
#bs;Warped by Corruption. A warp spawn is a term to describe a whole spectrum of mutated creatures warped into being by the corrupting influence of warpstone. Some manage to stave off this doom for a time, but, for most, the fate of becoming a warp spawn lies at the end of their dark and horrible road.
Warp spawn lose what little remained of their original forms, becoming a shifting mass of tentacles and eyes. A rare few retain just enough of their original forms to become truly horrific. Upon the moment of devolution, the subject is wracked with agonizing pangs as his body ripples and undulates. The pain is so great it destroys the mind, erasing nearly every memory, all emotion, and the capability of forming a coherent thought.
#bs;Miserable Existence. When a warp spawn comes shambling from its lair, it will behave in a largely unpredictable manner. The spawn will move towards the enemy and crashes flailing into them; teeth, claws, and tentacles tearing men limb from limb in a shower of blood and ruination. A warp spawn is a formidable opponent on its own, capable of slaughtering an entire group of adventurer, but the threat is poses does not resides solely on the brutal strength and flurry of attack of the creature, but in the corrupting touch that it spreads. The fate of a spawn is to die, either on the field of battle by axe or sword, torn apart in the wilds by even more savage creatures, or literally ripped asunder by the energies that continues to course through its twisted body. Mindless and utterly beyond reason, warp spawn relentlessly attack anything in their way, the blows of their enemies merely a strange relief to the endless insanity that is their miserable existence.
#bs;Herald of Change. Warp spawns are sometimes called “Herald of Change” in occult societies or cults that worship the alien entities lurking in the dimension of the Far Realm. Some eldritch ritual, involving the direct ingestion of warpstone or inhaling incent made of it, allow demented cultists to purposely turn into one of the wretched things, each mutation bringing the cultist closer to the “enlightenment” sought after. The creature carries the stench of the Far Realm wherever it goes, revolting reality by its very existence. If a warp spawn is killed, the cult fashions weapons out of its bone, carrying the essence of the being. These dreadful weapons are carried by cult leader or cultist of high ranks and able to transmit the warp touch disease, spreading the influence of their dark gods.
#h;Optional: Sickening Glow
Some aberrations radiate of the sickening glow of the warpstone. Thankfully these creature are pretty easy to identify, manifesting the same lightabsorbing quality as the warpstone itself. A creature with that option has the additional trait: Sickening Glow. Any creature other than an aberration, a construct or an undead that starts its turn within 20 feet of the aberration or enters the affected area for the first time on a turn must succeed a DC 13 Constitution saving throw Constitution saving throw or contract the Warp Touch disease. If a creature's saving throw is successful, it is immune to the aberration's Sickening Glow for the next 24 hours.

#h;Balewing
#bs;Spared by Fate. Balewings are some of the most diseased and disgusting of all warp spawns. It is said that the sight of them is so horrifying that hardened warriors are rendered incapable of any action while they gagged and retched in disgust. Many spawns die within minutes or hours of their transformation, being killed by their former companions or expiring as their impossibly mutated bodies give out under the strain. Such is not the fate of balewings, however. By some strange quirk of fate, they grow and prosper by ingesting and absorbing the fleshy tissues and fluids of living creatures. They achieve this by grabbing their victims with their tentacles, dissolving them with melting acid and slurping the fleshy goo that is left.
#bs;Dragons of Change. Balewings are thankfully rare and can only be found near important warpstone deposit or deep underground, where meteor struck the world eons ago. They are sometimes called “Dragons of the Deep” or “Dragons of Change” for this reason. The dwarves have learned to stay away from warpstone veins by fear of freeing such horror if they were to dig too deep. Still, some cultists are mad enough to wish to summon one, ongoing lengthy rituals and sacrifices to bring these “Dragons of Change” into this world.

Amphibious. The dluur can breathe air and water.
False Appearance. While the dluur remains motionless in water under the surface, it is indistinguishable from a normal patch of lure weed.
Lure. If a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the dluur and can see the dluur’s illicium, the dluur can force the creature to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw if the dluur isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed until the end of its next turn. While charmed, the creature must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as close as its speed allows toward the dluur.
The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
Actions
Multiattack. The dluur makes two claws attacks. It can use Acid Spit in place of any melee attack.

#zl;image;Dluur.jpg;Dluur
“Your friend has started mutated? Then your only hope is the pond of Stilldale, lure weed grows there, but beware the wicked things that lurk under the surface.” – Unorna, Wise Woman of Novece.
#bs;Aquatic Predator. Dluurs are likely mutated anglerfish, tainted by the presence of aquatic Warpstone deposit. They are usually found living in swamps, rivers or underground lakes where lure weed, the only known natural remedy against the Warp Touch disease, is present. They are often hiding under the surface to ambush their preys. The fleshy bioluminescent growth atop its head (called illicium) acts as a camouflage for the predator, effectively disguising it as the surrounding lure weed to fool its prey.
#bs;Luring Powers. Cautious travelers can spot these creatures hiding among lure weed and avoid a surprise attack. Otherwise, the dluur's illicium can be distinguished from the plant by the lack of leaves of a single appendage resting on the water's surface. Sometimes, the dluur's head can be visible under the surface and mistaken for these leaves from afar, but will remain submerged until the prey is close enough. The dluur is an aggressive creature with the ability to spit corrosive acid and lure its prey with minor psychic abilities. In combat, they often rely on these long ranged attacks, but have been observed to charge at their prey and use their claws, though often they will halt mid charge to use their preferred method.

Acid Blood. A creature that hits the dolgotha with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.
Acid Fog. A 20-foot-radius sphere of acid fog surrounds the dolgotha. The fog spreads around corners. Its area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 23 (5d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Strong wind disperses the fog for 1d4 turns before it returns.
Amphibious. The dolgotha can breathe air and water.
Fog Crawler. While in the fog, The dolgotha can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns and has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

Chelipeds . Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage.
Deadly Leap. If the dolgotha jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target' s choice) or be knocked prone and take 27 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (4d8 + 9) slashing damage.

Corrosive Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dolgotha exhales acid in 60-foot cone. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, and 23 (5d8) acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

#h;Dolgotha
#zl;image;Dolgotha.jpg;Dolgotha
“When you see the deep fog rolling in and you smell the acrid air, take your children inside and bar your doors, cover your windows and snuff out the lights. Listen for the moan in the distance, if you hear it, prey.” – Midek, fisherman of Brislava
#bs;Mutated from the Depth. Dolgothas, or fog crawlers, are predatory highly mutated crustacean-like creatures which live on islands, coastal regions, cold swamps or subterranean lakes. the overhauled anatomy of the creature points to a former aquatic crustacean, grown out of proportion due to the Warpstone influence. It seems that at some point the creature's head had evolved to become separate from the main carapace, as well as morphed into a kind of arrowhead shape for unknown reasons, possibly to be used for attacking. These creatures are remarkably tough, fast, and quite agile considering their size; capable of withstanding the deadliest spells and attacks.
#bs;Fast and Deadly. The dolgothas main attacks are slicing with its arms and jabbing with its head. It can also leap surprisingly high and slams back in to the ground, dealing massive amounts of damage to anything caught in the area of effect. Dolgothas have few ranged attacks, a shortcoming they compensate for with deceptively high speed and agility. The monstrous creatures can cover considerable distances very quickly, thus making it hard to shoot them down before they enter melee range, while making it all the more difficult to escape from them.
#bs;Monster in the Fog. Dolgothas are, despite their size, surprisingly hard to spot. Their exoskeleton adapts to the color of their environment, and, coupled with their uncanny ability to dissimulate in the fog, they may as well be invisible. The dolgotha emits a characteristic sound, akin to a low and deep moan, that often leads people to believe its hunting territory is haunted. It is therefore advised to always keep an ear out, to avoid running into one by accident. The dolgothas are nicknamed “Fog Crawlers”, for they always come with the fog. The truth is that the creature is the source of the supernatural fog, using it instinctively to dissimulate its approach. The fog directly surrounding the dolgotha is acid, like its blood, and will dissolve any creature coming close.
#bs;Bane of Sailors. In fishing towns and remote islands the dolgothas are seen as boogeymen, attracted by the wickedness of witches, the smell of rotten fish or strangers in town. These superstitions are usually false, but the presence of one of these monsters is certainly enough to spell doom over a community depending on fishing. Water turns acid in the creature’s presence, and in time, it can ultimately compromise an entire lake or section of the ocean. The creature is also known to attack boats, piercing the hull with its head and letting the unfortunate sailors drown or burn in the acid waters.
#h;A Moan in the Fog
The characteristic moan of a dolgotha can be recognized by a character familiar with the creature. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a character to identify the sound. The moan can carry over great distances, giving a vital warning that the fog covering the region hides more dangers than it seems.
#bp;Regional Effect
The region containing a dolgotha is tainted by the creature's presence, creating the following magical effects:
The region is constantly lightly obscured by fog, and creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. As an action, the dolgotha can condense the fog, making a 1 mile radius area heavily obscured for one hour.
Water sources within 30 feet of the dolgotha are supernaturally fouled. Creature that drink or swim in such water take 10 (3d6) acid damage at the beginning of their turn while exposed.
While in the region, creatures using telepathy, including spells such as detect thoughts, rary's telepathic bond, telepathy or natural telepathic abilities, must first succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the attempt fails as the mind of the creature is overcomed by a terrifying moan and the creature gains a short-term madness (see p.259 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
If the dolgotha dies, the effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.
#h;Variant: Pale One
Some legendary albino dolgothas, known as pale ones, have a strong connection to the Far Realm. A pale one with an Intelligence of 14 (+2) and a telepathy of 120 ft. has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP) and the following additional action option:
Reactions
Psychic Backslash. Immediately after a creature casts an illusion or enchantment spell that targets the dolgotha or includes it in its area of effect, the dolgotha can use its reaction to absorb the magic of the spell, cancelling its effect. Additionally, the creature that casted the spell must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage per level of the spell slot absorbed.

Hit: 21 (6d6) psychic damage and the target must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. At the end of a long rest, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this effect, ending the effect on itself on a success. A greater restoration spell cast on the target also ends the effect.

“It… it was calling my name! I could hear it, crawling in the attic, the sound of its legs on the floorboard, and the shriek, oh gods the shriek! I’ll never sleep again!” – incoherent report by unknown, found in Ritterbad’s Asylum archive.
#bs;Newfound Cunning. The uhogguath were once phase spiders that shifted accidently into a nexus of eldritch energies, tainting the creature. Instead of being torn apart by inconceivable forces, it emerged from the rift with a newfound cunning, a thirst for the secrets and thoughts contained inside the head of every intelligent creature.
#bs;Ethereal Lurker. The uhogguath is a cunning predator, lurking on the border of the Ethereal Plane in ambush, waiting for a weak prey to come its way or stalking a group of creature until they are vulnerable. If the creature faces overwhelming odds it will retreat to return at more opportune times. Some uhogguath hunt in group, building a gigantic and twisted ethereal web that can alert them to the presence of creatures on both planes for miles around.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the werewolf's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
Legendary Actions
The ulfheddin can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The werewolf regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Move. The werewolf moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
The Beast Within (Costs 2 Actions). The ulfheddin targets one creature cursed with lycanthropy that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the creature instantly polymorph into its hybrid form, cannot shapeshift back to other forms, and is charmed by the ulfhedinn. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Eye of Winter (Costs 2 Actions). The ulfheddin targets one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it.

#h;Ulfhedinn
#zl;image;Ulfhedinn.jpg;Ulfhedinn
“Ulfhedinn? What's that, some kind of fish?” - Professor Artibus Joannes Rack, geographer, disappeared during a surveying expedition in the northern lands.
Winter's Fury. Ulfhedinn are a breed of werewolf found mainly in arctic or cold parts of the world. The harsh and barren conditions of these lands might explain why they primarily hunt men and are stronger than their southern brethren. They have an intimate connection with the forces of winter and thrive in freezing temperature, using blizzard and snow storm to dissimulate their approach. Only a few daring warriors in history have managed to defeat an ulfhedinn, and each of them is commemorated in ballads as a hero to this day.
Too Far Gone. It is believed that ulfhedinn were once simple werewolves, but in time empowered the curse by killing and feeding on countless human lives. As their power grew, so did the curse, and they finally became incapable to take any other form than that of a deadly hybrid. The werewolf became their true nature, and the person they once were is definitively gone. No stories exist of ulfhedinns being freed from their curse, and most experts agree that the curse is simply impossible to break once it reaches that point. Some rare texts also mention a potent curse that can only be performed during the winter solstice, a curse capable of turning a murderer dressed with a winter wolf pelt into an ulfheddin.
Predator King. Ulfhedinn are often called “Wolf King” in ballads and legends, and indeed packs of predator seem to instinctively defer to them, particularly dire wolves and winter wolves. The pack show signs of respect to the werewolf, leaving fresh kill at the entrance of its cave or directing preys toward its lair, cutting all possible retreat and watching their supreme alpha take the kill. Those affected by lycanthropy can feel their inner beast stir within them as the werewolf approaches, for these predator kings have the power to awake the beast inside any cursed shapeshifter, forcing them to change and serve him as the king of hunters.
#h;Unbreakable Curse
The ulfhedinn is what awaits every werewolf that lives long enough to take countless lives and become a monster driven only by a constant bloodlust. Lycanthropy can usually be cured with magic, such as the remove curse spell or more powerful effects, but in the case of the ulfhedinn, such spells are useless. There is no known way to reverse the curse once it progresses that far, the person they once were is only vaguely present in some small habits or the werewolf favorite prey.
#h;An Ulfhedinn's Lair
Ulfheddin favor caves or abandonned structures located deep in snowy forests or high in the mountains to make their lair. The ground is littered with the bones from their past hunts.
Regional Effect
The region containing an ulfhedinn's lair is altered by the creature's presence, creating the following magical effects:
#ls;
#li;The weather is always cold and unforgiving in the region.
#li;The ulfhedinn, can call on heavy snow storm and extreme cold at will (Heavy Precipitation & Extreme Cold, p.110 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide)
#li;Packs of dire wolves and winter wolves roam the region. The creatures are charmed by the ulfhedinn and are extremely aggressive toward intruders in the area.
#li;Lycanthropes can feel the power of the ulfhedinn affecting them while they are in the region. A creature cursed with lycanthropy that is taking a long rest in the region must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the creature polymorph into its hybrid form and act accordingly to the alignment of its form of lycanthropy for the duration of the long rest. The creature has no recollection of what it did while transformed.
#le;
When the ulfhedinn is killed, all of these regional effects fade over 10 days.

Shapechanger. The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form.
Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
Keen Hearing and Smell. The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
Regeneration. The voref regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the werewolf takes damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of the werewolf's next turn .
Rejuvenation. If the werewolf is killed, it regains all its hit points in 24 hours, unless wolfsbane is placed on its body, in which case it will take 1d10 days to rejuvenate. If silver pierces the heart of the werewolf during the full moon, the werewolf is truly dead.
Rend. If a voref hits a creature with both claw attacks on the same turn, it latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. The target takes an extra 20 (4d6 + 6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated by pain until the beginning of the werewolf's next turn.
Voref Weaknesses. The voref has the following flaws:\rCall of the Moon. During the night of the full moon the true nature of the voref is revealed. The creature automatically polymorph into its hybrid form and acts according to its alignment. The werewolf is also free to ignore its master’s order during these nights.\rVoice of the Master. The voref is completely under the thrall of the person that cursed it. It is considered under the permanent effects of the dominate monster spell from its master.\rWolsbane Allergy. If the werewolf comes within 20 feet of aconitum flowers it is poisoned until it leaves the area. Weapons coated with aconitum oil ignore the damage invulnerabilities of the werewolf.
Actions
Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only). The voref uses its Howl at the Moon, if available, and makes two claw attacks and one bite attack.
Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft.,one target. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) piercing damage.
Claw (Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
Howl at the Moon (Hybrid Form Only; Recharge 5-6). The werewolf howls with an insane look in its eyes. All creatures within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be under the effects of a confusion spell for one minute. At the end of each of its turn a creature can reattempt the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

#zl;image;Voref.jpg;Voref
"Wolves aren't as bad as they're made out to be. Werewolves, though — they're every bit as bad and worse."— Elsa Vilge, archer
#bs;Cursed Monster. Neither animal, nor man, the werewolf takes the worst from both species: the bloodlust and primal nature of a wolf, and the ruthlessness and cruelty of a human. One becomes a voref werewolf as a result of a curse thrown by a spellcaster -- the change itself is uncontrollable and unwilling. The voref can be called upon by the witch that cursed it, playing the role of unknowing assassin or enforcer. A man who transforms back to his human form can’t usually remember the atrocious acts committed as a werewolf — otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life, to no end since the curse won’t even allow him this relief.
#bs;Bound in Death. Killing a voref for good can prove difficult, for the magic of the curse binds it in death as well, bringing it back to life if slayed. The only known way to prevent this is to pierce its heart with a silver weapon during the full moon, or to force the spellcaster that cursed it to lift the spell. The voref's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire method for doing this. A group of adventurers seeking to undertake such a task must equip themselfves with a great deal of patience – and sturdy armors.
#bs;Hidden Killer.Hunting a voref is extremely hard and dangerous due to the hidden nature of the werewolf. The werewolf seems perfectly normal and do not manifest the classic symptoms of lycanthropy while the curse lies dormant, until its master decides to trigger it. Still, werewolves are creatures of the night and they are especially active during the full moon, as such, vorefs must transform during the full moon, just as other werewolves. Vorefs are also very allergic to aconitum, also known as “wolfsbane”, making them avoid areas where the plant grows.
#bs;Lone Hunter. A Voref usually goes hunting alone, carrying the order of its master, as there rarely is an opponent that can match its strength, agility and fast health regeneration. It strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors and regenerate any damage received in mere moments. If a voref actually encounters an enemy that has equivalent strength and can fight a fair fight, the werewolf will fight to the death to accomplish its mission, caring little for its own safety.
#h;Curse of the Voref
The curse of a voref werewolf operates quite differently from common lycanthropy on a mystical level. As such, the bite of a voref does not spread the curse, for the magic is contained inside the unfortunate vessel. During the full moon, a spellcaster that knows the bestow curse spell can expand a 9th level slot to cast the curse. A wish spell can inflict the curse as well. Until the next full moon, the curse can be dispelled as any spell would, but once it reaches that point only the person that casted it can revoke it. Alternatively, a wish spell casted specifically to break the curse will also work if the werewolf lies dead.

Feral zombies are the most aggressive zombies that can be found, they roam in packs and run after any source of food they can find. They are surprisingly fast compared to their slower kind. What makes them truly dangerous is that, at first glance, nothing allows to tell them apart from regular zombies, until they start moving at an alarming speed.

#h;Shambling Lord
#zl;image;shambling lord.jpg;Shambling Lord
“There will come a day so dark you will pray for death. On that day your prayers will be answered.” – Minaldra, the Vizag Atum.
#bs;Psionically Gifted. Shambling lords are zombies imbued with psionic powers, inherited from their mortal life. Shambling lords can be ritually created through the dark art of necromancy, but most of the rituals where lost or destroyed by religious orders a long time ago. Still, some secrets regarding their creation might linger in sealed library and forbidden archives. On rare occasions, a shambling lord will rise from the corpse of a psionically gifted humanoid, keeping its memories and somewhat twisted personality, but enslaved by an overwhelming craving for the flesh and brains of the living.
#bs;Master of the Endless Tide. Shambling lords possess powerful psionic abilities, and can induce a hive mind in their lesser kind, creating swarms as zombies bound in tight clutter and follow the will of its superior mind. This make hordes of zombies especially dangerous as a single zombie can bring down an army of undead should it find a source of food, or the target of its master's wrath. In battle a shambling lord tend to stay at long range, bombarding its enemies with psychic attacks while swarms of zombies assail them from all side. If threatened, the shambling lord will retreat, sacrificing its endless minions to get away.
#bs;Secrets of a Corpse. Shambling lords are also known for their extensive knowledge on an incalculable number of topics, ranging from ancient history to the latest town gossip. This well of knowledge seems to come from the hive mind they generate, allowing them to recollect any information known by a member of the horde or from the brains they like to feast on. Daring scholars, or plainly insane occultists, will sometime seek the lost knowledge only known by these strange undead, often ending up joining their legions of servants and adding their own insights to the common mind.
#bs;Unpredictable Minds. Most necromancers would never raise a shambling lord on purpose, for they are too unpredictable servants, capable of turning on their master. The other reason is that almost all shambling lords are utterly mad creatures, their mind separated and shared amongst potentially hundreds or thousands of individuals. The personality of a shambling lord consist of several dominant traits from the strongest characters inside the hive mind, battling for control over the hordes or the shambling lord’s body.
